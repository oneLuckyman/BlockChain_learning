13541
13:43:40,070 --> 13:43:46,220
So let's go ahead and let's create a new folder. 
让我们继续，来创建一个新的文件夹

13542
13:43:46,220 --> 13:43:50,810
So we're gonna do MK dir, hardhat, smart contract lottery, FCC 
`mkdir hardhat-smartcontract-lottery-fcc`

13543
13:43:50,810 --> 13:43:55,130
or smart contract, raffle, whatever you want to call it, 
或者叫 `smartcontract-raffle`，随你的便了

13544
13:43:55,130 --> 13:43:58,160
then we're going to cd into our hard hat, smart contract lottery Free Code Camp. 
接着，我们 `cd` 进入到我们的 `hardhat-smartcontract-lottery-fcc`

13545
13:43:58,400 --> 13:44:01,160
And we're going to type code period, 
然后输入 `code .`

13546
13:44:01,160 --> 13:44:04,670
or we're going to open this up in a new folder, however we choose to do. 
或者我们也可以在一个新的文件夹中打开它，看你的选择了

13547
13:44:04,700 --> 13:44:07,430
So now that we're in our new folder,
现在我们已经有了一个新的文件夹

13548
13:44:07,460 --> 13:44:11,210
we're going to create our new hard hat project. 
可以开始创建我们新的 Hardhat 项目了

13549
13:44:11,210 --> 13:44:19,730
So we're going to do yarn, add dash dash dev hard hat. 
我们来执行 `yarn add --dev hardhat`

13550
13:44:19,730 --> 13:44:23,150
And we'll get our node modules are package dot JSON and our yarn dot lock. 
我们获得了 "node_modules", "package.json" 以及 "yarn.lock"

13551
13:44:23,150 --> 13:44:26,630
Now we'll do yarn hardhat. To get started with a new project, 
现在我们运行 `yarn hardhat`，开启一个新的项目

13552
13:44:26,630 --> 13:44:30,200
and we're just going to select create an empty hard hat dot config dot j s 
我们直接选择“创建一个空的 hardhat.config.js”
("Create an empty hardhat.config.js")

13553
13:44:30,200 --> 13:44:32,900
because we know what a basic project looks like. 
因为我们知道一个基本的项目是什么样子的

13554
13:44:32,900 --> 13:44:35,150
And we're gonna give this project the customizations that we want to see, 
并且我们要对这个项目做一些我们想要的自定义配置

13555
13:44:35,150 --> 13:44:37,940
we're going to create an empty hard hat dot config. 
我们将创建一个空的 "hardhat.config"

13556
13:44:37,940 --> 13:44:42,140
And now in here we have a blank hardhead.config.js with almost nothing in here. 
现在，我们就有了这个空白的 "hardhat.config.js"，这里几乎没有任何内容

13557
13:44:42,140 --> 13:44:44,420
So we're starting completely from scratch. 
我们几乎是完全的从头开始

13558
13:44:44,420 --> 13:44:47,420
Now we're going to add all of our dependencies in here.
现在我们就要在这里添加我们所有的依赖项了

13559
13:44:47,450 --> 13:44:50,870
And oftentimes, you'll add these sequentially as you build 
通常，你会按照顺序来添加它们

13560
13:44:50,870 --> 13:44:54,110
but we're just going to add them all in one line, 
但我们打算直接一行就把它们全部都添加了

13561
13:44:54,110 --> 13:44:57,350
and there are a lot of them. So we've left a copy, paste the whole section of the full blockchain solidity course, J S, 
它们真的太多了，所以我们在 "full-blockchain-solidity-course-js" 中留下了一个可供复制粘贴的部分

13562
13:44:57,350 --> 13:45:00,320
for you to just copy, paste, so you can install everything in one go. 
这样你就可以直接复制粘贴，一次性安装所有内容了

13563
13:45:00,320 --> 13:45:03,530
So grab that line, and it's going to have everything that we've been talking about. 
获取这一行，它包含了我们要讨论的所有内容

13564
13:45:03,530 --> 13:45:05,420
And we'll just hit enter, and we'll install all of these. 
我们只要按下 Enter，就会安装所有的这些东西了

13565
13:45:05,420 --> 13:45:09,080
And as you create more and more projects, 
随着你创建的项目越来越多

13566
13:45:09,080 --> 13:45:09,560
you'll get the feel of what you like for your dependencies 
你会感知到哪些依赖库是你喜欢的

13567
13:45:10,820 --> 13:45:13,850
and what tools that you like to use. 
以及哪些工具是你爱用的

13568
13:45:13,850 --> 13:45:16,430
Remember, at the end of the day, 
记住，每当一天的工作结束时

13569
13:45:16,580 --> 13:45:20,060
the tool that's best for you and best for the job is the tool that you like the most. 
对你和你的工作而言，最好的工具就是你最喜欢的工具

13570
13:45:20,060 --> 13:45:23,240
There never really is a one tool fits all,
从来没有一种工具可以应对所有的情形

13571
13:45:23,240 --> 13:45:26,540
there's almost always going to be trade offs. 
几乎总是会有取舍

13572
13:45:26,570 --> 13:45:30,770
Alright, now that we have all those dependencies installed, 
好了，现在我们已经安装好了全部依赖

13573
13:45:30,770 --> 13:45:32,990
if we look at our package, JSON will have this massive dev dependencies, 
如果我们看一下 "package.json"，里面会有这么一大堆依赖库

13574
13:45:32,990 --> 13:45:36,020
we'll have everything in Node modules will have everything in yarn dot lock. 
我们所需的所有东西都已经在 "node_modules" 和 "yarn.lock" 里了

13575
13:45:36,020 --> 13:45:38,750
And of course, as we know, in order for any of these to actually work, 
当然了，我们都知道，要想让它们都能生效

13576
13:45:38,750 --> 13:45:41,810
we need to add them into our Hardhead config.
还需要把它们都添加进我们的 "hardhat.config" 中

13577
13:45:41,810 --> 13:45:45,140
Now, there's a lot of stuff to add in here as well. 
现在，还有一堆东西也需要添加

13578
13:45:45,380 --> 13:45:48,530
So like once again, if you want to come to the heart at smart contract, lottery, FCC, 
所以再一次，如果你愿意的话，可以来到 "hardhat-smartcontract-lottery-fcc" 这里

13579
13:45:48,530 --> 13:45:51,650
and go to the Hardhead config, 
打开 "hardhat.config"

13580
13:45:51,650 --> 13:45:55,700
you can just copy paste everything and place it into your project 
你可以直接复制粘贴这里的所有内容到你的项目中去

13581
13:45:55,700 --> 13:45:59,180
so that you don't have to always type everything out yourself. 
这样你就不用总是亲自输入这些内容了

13582
13:45:59,180 --> 13:46:02,450
Meclabs Hardhead waffle anomic labs started ether scan harder to deploy 
"nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle", "nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan", "hardhat-deploy"

13583
13:46:02,450 --> 13:46:05,120
slitted coverage, or had gas reporter heart had contract sizer, 
"solidity-coverage", "hardhat-gas-reporter", "hardhat-contract-sizer"

13584
13:46:05,120 --> 13:46:08,090
which we haven't talked about yet. But we will Don't worry. 
有些我们还没有谈到过，但不用担心，之后会的

13585
13:46:08,090 --> 13:46:10,790
And then require dot env dot config. 
最后是 `require("dotenv").config()`

13586
13:46:10,790 --> 13:46:14,420
And as you all know, all these little semicolons are popping up 
还有，你是知道的，这些分号又出现了

13587
13:46:14,450 --> 13:46:17,030
and those are going to drive me absolutely crazy. 
它们会让我疯掉的

13588
13:46:17,030 --> 13:46:20,840
So once again, we can create a dot prettier, RC. 
所以再一次，我们创建一个 ".prettierrc"

13589
13:46:20,870 --> 13:46:25,220
And if you want to copy this as well, 
如果你愿意的话，这个也可以复制

13590
13:46:25,220 --> 13:46:29,300
from one of your previous projects are free to do so. 
就是从你之前的项目里，请自便吧

13591
13:46:29,300 --> 13:46:33,320
One thing that I added in here was a print width of 100. 
这里要额外添加一项的内容是 `"printWidth": 100`

13592
13:46:33,350 --> 13:46:36,320
This just changes how long a line can be before it goes on to a new line. 
它只是改变了一行文字可以有多长，超过该长度将换行显示

13593
13:46:36,320 --> 13:46:39,560
That's the only difference here. 
这就是唯一的区别

13594
13:46:39,560 --> 13:46:43,370
Now if we go to our config and hit save, they go away, thank goodness. 
现在我们前往 "config" 然后点击保存，哈，它们不见了，真是谢天谢地

13595
13:46:43,430 --> 13:46:47,000
Now if we look at our solidity version, 
现在我们再来看一下我们的 solidity 版本

13596
13:46:47,000 --> 13:46:50,780
we're currently using zero point 7.3. 
目前我们使用的是 "0.7.3"

13597
13:46:50,780 --> 13:46:53,990
Let's go ahead and update that to 8.8 or 8.7, or whatever you want to use. 
我们来把它更新到 "8.8" 或是 "8.7"，你想用哪个都行

13598
13:46:53,990 --> 13:47:00,140
Now that we have all the basic setup, we can begin coding our smart contracts. 
现在我们已经完成了所有的基本设置，可以开始编写智能合约了
