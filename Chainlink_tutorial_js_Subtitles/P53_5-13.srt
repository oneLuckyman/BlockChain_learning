7284
07:12:12,160 --> 07:12:18,490
Well, what else can we do? 
好了，现在我们还可以做些什么

7285
07:12:18,490 --> 07:12:21,670
Well, we can wait for a certain number of blocks for our contract finish with 
我们可以等待一定数量的区块，直到我们的合约完成

7286
07:12:21,670 --> 07:12:25,120
so we've deployed the contract. 
现在我们已经部署好了合约

7287
07:12:25,120 --> 07:12:28,960
But maybe we want to wait one block to make sure it actually gets attached to the chain. 
但我们也可能会想要等待一个区块以确保它确实已经上链了

7288
07:12:28,960 --> 07:12:32,290
So we can say 
所以我们可以写 

7289
07:12:33,010 --> 07:12:39,850
const.Deployment received equals await, contract dot deploy transaction dot Wait, 
"const deploymentReceipt = await contract.deployTransaction.wait()"

7290
07:12:40,240 --> 07:12:43,570
and specify the number of confirmations that we want to actually wait. 
并且需要指定我们想要等待确认的确切数量

7291
07:12:43,570 --> 07:12:46,780
So we'll wait one block confirmation to make sure that this happened. 
所以我们将等待一个区块确认以确保该做的都做好了

7292
07:12:46,780 --> 07:12:50,140
And then we can do console dot log, 
然后我们可以 "console.log()"

7293
07:12:50,140 --> 07:12:55,420
this deployment receipt option. 
里面填上这个 "deploymentReceipt" 选项

7294
07:12:55,420 --> 07:13:01,030
So if we run the code now, we can see all this information about our transaction, 
如果我们现在运行代码，可以看到有关我们交易的所有信息

7295
07:13:01,060 --> 07:13:04,840
and we can see exactly what our transaction looks like, 
可以精确地看到我们的交易是什么样的

7296
07:13:04,840 --> 07:13:09,130
we can see there's two is no because we're creating a contract 
可以看到 "to" 是 "null" 因为我们是在创建合约

7297
07:13:09,130 --> 07:13:13,630
from is going to be this ganache address that we got the private key for, 
"from" 是我们使用的那个私钥所对应的 Ganache 地址

7298
07:13:13,630 --> 07:13:17,110
we see the contract address that we created
"contractAddress" 就是我们创建的这个合约

7299
07:13:17,140 --> 07:13:21,250
transaction index, we can see gas use gas use log bloom block hash transaction, 
还有 "transactionIndex", "gasUsed", "logsBloom", "blockHash", "transactionHash"

7300
07:13:21,250 --> 07:13:24,850
and we can see all this information about our transaction, 
总之我们能看到有关我们交易的所有信息

7301
07:13:24,850 --> 07:13:27,550
something I want you to take note of is the deployment receipt and the deployment transaction, 
我想让你注意的是这个 "deploymentReceipt" 以及 "deployTransaction"

7302
07:13:27,550 --> 07:13:31,480
I want you to separate these two because it's going to make your life a lot easier. 
我希望你能把这两个东西区分开，这样可以让你舒服很多

7303
07:13:31,480 --> 07:13:33,550
So we're going to do quick console dot log, 
我们来快速处理一下 "console.log"

7304
07:13:33,550 --> 07:13:36,640
here is the deployment transaction. 
"Here is the deployment transaction: "

7305
07:13:36,640 --> 07:13:43,990
And then we'll do console dot log 
接着是 "console.log"

7306
07:13:43,990 --> 07:13:50,620
contract, dot deploy transaction. 
"contract.deployTransaction"

7307
07:13:50,620 --> 07:13:54,370
And then I'm going to copy this whole line by just typing Command C or Ctrl. C right there. 
然后我要复制这一整行，使用 "Command C" 或是 "Ctrl C"

7308
07:13:54,370 --> 07:13:59,890
And then here is the deployment. Here is the transaction receipt. 
这里把 "Here is the deployment" 改成 "Here is the transaction receipt"

7309
07:13:59,920 --> 07:14:04,690
And then this deployment is receipt is the transaction receipt. 
这里写的是 "deploymentReceipt" 而这里是 "transaction receipt"

7310
07:14:04,690 --> 07:14:07,120
So I'm just going to rename this to transaction receipt. 
所以我要把这里重命名成 "transactionReceipt"

7311
07:14:07,120 --> 07:14:10,960
To make it a little bit clearer, which ones which, 
为了让它更清晰，哪个是哪个

7312
07:14:10,960 --> 07:14:15,040
and we'll run this one more time. 
我们再运行一次

7313
07:14:15,040 --> 07:14:19,090
You only get a transaction receipt, when you wait for a block confirmation.
你只有在等待区块确认时才能获得交易回执("transaction receipt")

7314
07:14:19,150 --> 07:14:21,880
Otherwise, you're gonna get the contract object, which has the deploy transaction with it, 
否则，你得到的就只有合约对象，以及它包含的部署交易("deploy transaction")信息

7315
07:14:21,880 --> 07:14:24,610
this distinction will be more important later on. 
这种差异之后才会显得比较重要

7316
07:14:24,610 --> 07:14:27,460
But I wanted you to know what the difference between the two 
但我现在就想让你们知道这二者的区别

7317
07:14:27,460 --> 07:14:30,850
transaction receipt is what you get when you wait for a block confirmation, 
交易回执是你等待区块确认时获得的

7318
07:14:30,850 --> 07:14:34,240
the deployment transaction or the transaction response, transaction response 
而部署交易或者说是交易响应("transaction response")

7319
07:14:34,240 --> 07:14:38,650
is what you get just when you create your transaction. 
则是在你创建交易时获得的

7320
07:14:38,650 --> 07:14:41,680
So transaction receipts transactional response, they're different 
所以这个是交易回执，这个是交易响应，它们是不同的

7321
07:14:41,680 --> 07:14:44,560
receipt is what you get when you wait for a transaction to finish. 
回执是你的等待交易完成时获得的东西

7322
07:14:44,560 --> 07:14:47,140
And then response is just what you initially get. 
而响应则是你一开始就会获得东西

7323
07:14:47,140 --> 07:14:49,990
Make sense? Okay, great. 
讲清楚了吧？OK 很好

7324
07:14:49,990 --> 07:14:52,600
We're gonna go ahead and delete those. 
我们要把这些东西删掉

7325
07:14:52,600 --> 07:14:58,570
But those lines will be in the code associated with the GitHub. 
不过它们仍然会在课程关联的 GitHub 中显示出来
