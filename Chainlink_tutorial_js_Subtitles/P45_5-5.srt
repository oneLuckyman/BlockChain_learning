6321
06:12:51,339 --> 06:12:54,429
And then finally, our last setup is going to be using a tool called Git pod 
最后一个我们可选的工具是 Gitpod

6322
06:12:54,429 --> 06:12:57,399
starting from Lesson five. The lesson that we're on right now, ethers, jazz, simple storage, 
从第五章开始，就是我们现在正在进行这一章 "Ethers.js Simple Storage"

6323
06:12:57,399 --> 06:13:00,279
all of our code repos are going to come with a button 
我们所有的代码仓库都会带有一个按钮

6324
06:13:00,279 --> 06:13:04,509
in the repo scroll down, 
在仓库内向下滚动

6325
06:13:04,509 --> 06:13:08,499
they'll come with this open in get pod button. 
它们都会附带一个 "Open in Gitpod"(在 Gitpod 中打开) 按钮

6326
06:13:08,499 --> 06:13:11,949
Now git pod is a cloud development environment 
Gitpod 是一种云开发环境

6327
06:13:11,949 --> 06:13:16,449
where you can actually run your code on a remote server, 
它可以让你在远程服务器上运行你的代码

6328
06:13:16,449 --> 06:13:20,199
it's kind of similar to remix IDE, 
有些类似于 Remix IDE

6329
06:13:20,199 --> 06:13:25,029
but it allows you to run Visual Studio code in the browser or connected to another server. 
不过它只是允许你在浏览器上或是以连接到其他服务器的方式运行 Visual Studio Code

6330
06:13:25,029 --> 06:13:27,939
This is good because then you don't have to do any installation on anything.
这很不错，因为这样你就不用安装各种东西了

6331
06:13:28,149 --> 06:13:31,089
Since all the tools that you can want to use are just going to be running on this remote server. 
因为你要使用的所有工具都会在这个远程服务器上运行

6332
06:13:31,089 --> 06:13:34,839
This has its downsides, though, obviously, 
但是它的缺点也很明显

6333
06:13:34,839 --> 06:13:39,039
since you'll only be able to code if git pod is up and working for you. 
因为你只有在 Gitpod 启动并正常工作时才能编写代码

6334
06:13:39,039 --> 06:13:41,469
Additionally, when it comes to private keys, 
此外，当涉及私钥时

6335
06:13:41,469 --> 06:13:45,669
you absolutely do not want to run any code with a private key that has real money in good pop. 
你肯定不想用一个有真金白银的私钥在 Gitpod 上运行代码

6336
06:13:45,669 --> 06:13:49,479
Why? Well, once again, 
为什么？

6337
06:13:49,479 --> 06:13:53,259
since you're running your scripts on a remote server,
因为你是在远程服务器上运行的你的脚本

6338
06:13:53,529 --> 06:13:57,519
those servers have access to your private keys. 
所以这些服务器可以访问你的私钥

6339
06:13:57,519 --> 06:14:00,849
But since you've Pinky promise that for this course, you're not going to be using a meta mask or a private key with actual money in it, 
但是既然你都向本课程拉钩承诺过，你不会往 MetaMask 或私钥中放真钱

6340
06:14:00,849 --> 06:14:03,789
it should be fine. 
所以这应该也不是什么大问题

6341
06:14:03,789 --> 06:14:07,119
The other downside is that these often cost money to use and get pot isn't free. 
另一个缺点是使用这些工具通常需要花钱，Gitpod 并不是免费的

6342
06:14:07,119 --> 06:14:11,289
But it's an option if you absolutely cannot get any of the installation working. 
但这仍然不失为一种选择，如果你确实没法进行工具的安装

6343
06:14:11,319 --> 06:14:15,129
So if you go ahead and you hit this opening get pod button, 
所以如果你继续并点击了这个 "Open in Gitpod" 按钮

6344
06:14:15,129 --> 06:14:18,069
you'll get a welcome to get pods showing up. 
你就可以看到这个 "Welcome to Gitpod" 的界面

6345
06:14:18,069 --> 06:14:20,919
We're gonna go ahead and continue with GitHub. 
我们继续在这里选择 "Continue with GitHub"

6346
06:14:20,919 --> 06:14:24,009
Since you've signed up for GitHub here, 
因为你已经注册过了 Github

6347
06:14:24,009 --> 06:14:29,319
you want to go ahead and authorize get pod. 
你需要继续并授权给 Gitpod

6348
06:14:29,319 --> 06:14:32,859
And it'll go ahead and start creating this workspace for you. 
接着它就会开始为你创建工作区

6349
06:14:32,859 --> 06:14:36,939
And you'll notice it looks exactly like Visual Studio Code. 
你会发现它看起来和 Visual Studio Code 一模一样

6350
06:14:36,939 --> 06:14:41,889
Since I opened the repo up in Git pod, it came with all the code, 
因为我在 Gitpod 中打开了代码仓库，所以这里附带了所有的代码

6351
06:14:41,889 --> 06:14:47,049
and you can even open this workspace up in VS code desktop. 
你甚至可以在桌面 VS Code 中打开这个工作区

6352
06:14:47,049 --> 06:14:50,109
So this is might be a little bit confusing. 
不过这可能会让人感到有些迷惑

6353
06:14:50,109 --> 06:14:54,309
But basically, you can run off of Git pod using your local Visual Studio code.
不过基本上来说，你是可以用本地的 Visual Studio Code 来运行 Gitpod 的

6354
06:14:54,519 --> 06:14:57,159
And if you see git pod here, that's how you know that you're running off of Git pod. 
如果你在这个地方看到了 gitpod，就表明你是在通过 Gitpod 运行

6355
06:14:57,159 --> 06:15:00,639
If you see this pop up, 
如果你看到了这个弹窗

6356
06:15:00,639 --> 06:15:04,809
do you want to open this workspace in VS code desktop, you can hit Open. 
“你想要使用桌面 VS Code 打开此工作区么”，你可以点击 "Open"

6357
06:15:04,809 --> 06:15:07,299
And it'll ask you if you want to open up Visual Studio Code,
它就会询问你是否想要打开 Visual Studio Code

6358
06:15:07,569 --> 06:15:10,299
which I'm going to go ahead and hit yes. 
我们继续并选择“是的”

6359
06:15:10,299 --> 06:15:13,239
And you'll get something that looks like this on your Visual Studio Code.
接着你就会在你的 Visual Studio Code 里得到类似这样的东西

6360
06:15:13,449 --> 06:15:16,389
It'll tell you that it wants to install the Git pod extension, and then open that Git pod URL. 
它会询问你是否想要安装 Gitpod 扩展并打开 Gitpod 链接

6361
06:15:16,809 --> 06:15:20,619
So you can go ahead and install it. 
所以你可以选择继续并安装它

6362
06:15:20,619 --> 06:15:25,809
Reload window and open 
选择“重新启动窗口并打开”

6363
06:15:25,809 --> 06:15:29,739
and it's going to go ahead and start connecting to our the Git pod workspace. 
然后它就会开始连接到我们的 Gitpod 工作区

6364
06:15:29,739 --> 06:15:34,419
And this is going to be the same as running git pod in the browser here. 
这种方式和在浏览器里运行 Gitpod 是一样

6365
06:15:34,419 --> 06:15:38,079
Or you can also do it manually by hitting the Git pod in the bottom left,
或者你可以手动点击左下角的 Gitpod 按钮

6366
06:15:38,799 --> 06:15:42,219
and then type in open in VS code
然后输入 "Open in VS Code"

6367
06:15:43,660 --> 06:15:45,820
And then you should be able to run it in your Visual Studio code. 
然后你就可以在 Visual Studio Code 中运行它了

6368
06:15:45,820 --> 06:15:48,430
For now, I'm going to recommend that if you're using Git pod, just stay in the browser, 
目前，如果你使用的是 Gitpod，那么我建议你留在浏览器内

6369
06:15:48,430 --> 06:15:51,670
just so that you know, okay, 
这只是为了时刻提醒你

6370
06:15:51,700 --> 06:15:55,420
I am running this on a remote server. And just as a reminder for you that you're not actually locally developing. 
现在是在远程服务器上运行，而不是在本地进行开发

6371
06:15:55,420 --> 06:15:59,710
And hopefully, this will be a trigger to not actually put 
希望这可以提醒你

6372
06:15:59,710 --> 06:16:02,440
any special private keys or anything like that. 
不要往上面放任何私钥之类的东西

6373
06:16:02,440 --> 06:16:05,380
But you can make workspaces, you can make new folders, 
不过你可以新建工作区，新建文件夹

6374
06:16:05,380 --> 06:16:08,080
and you should be able to run all the commands on here, 
并且应该能够运行这里的所有命令

6375
06:16:08,080 --> 06:16:11,740
as if you are running locally with Visual Studio code. 
就好像你在本地运行 Visual Studio Code 一样

6376
06:16:11,740 --> 06:16:14,980
To open up the terminal, you can hit this little bar at the top left, 
要想打开终端，可以点击左上角这个小栏

6377
06:16:14,980 --> 06:16:20,500
go to terminal, new terminal, or use CTRL tilde 
再点击 "Terminal", "New Terminal" 或者使用 CTRL + ~

6378
06:16:20,530 --> 06:16:25,780
exact same as Mac OS and Linux keyboard shortcuts
就和 Mac OS 以及 Linux 的键盘快捷键完全相同

6379
06:16:25,930 --> 06:16:30,580
to create a new folder, we can change directory, CD, dot.mk, dir, new folder, 
要想创建一个新的文件夹，我们可以更改目录 "cd .." "mkdir new_folder"

6380
06:16:30,580 --> 06:16:36,070
MK dir makes make directory called New Folder. 
"mkdir" 就是新建一个文件夹，名为 "new_folder"

6381
06:16:36,070 --> 06:16:39,490
And then we're going to change our directory into a new folder, and hit enter. 
然后我们要改变我们的目录到 new_folder 下，敲击回车

6382
06:16:39,490 --> 06:16:42,940
And now we're in that new folder. 
现在我们就是在 new_folder 里了

6383
06:16:42,940 --> 06:16:46,270
For each section, you can either open up the entire source code right into GitHub, 
对于每个章节，你都可以直接在 Gitpod 中打开整个源代码

6384
06:16:46,300 --> 06:16:50,200
or you can create a new folder for each section yourself and start from blank. 
或者你可以自己为每个章节创建一个新的文件夹并从头开始

6385
06:16:50,230 --> 06:16:53,770
And then you would just type code period. 
你只需要输入 "code ."

6386
06:16:53,800 --> 06:17:01,480
And you'd be in a brand new folder.
然后你就是在一个全新的文件夹里了
