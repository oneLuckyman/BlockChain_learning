12611
12:45:32,260 --> 12:45:38,920
So in here, let's make a quick readme.md. 
现在，让我们来快速创建一个 "README.md" 文件

12612
12:45:38,920 --> 12:45:40,990
Just so we can talk about what we're going to be making here. 
这样我们就可以讨论一下接下来我们要处理的内容

12613
12:45:40,990 --> 12:45:44,620
So in this section, we're gonna be using raw HTML slash JavaScript 
在这一节中，我们将先使用原始的 "HTML / JavaScript" 

12614
12:45:44,620 --> 12:45:47,470
in conjunction with our smart contracts to build this website.
结合我们的智能合约来构建这个网站

12615
12:45:47,590 --> 12:45:52,000
Later on. We will use next Jas slash react, 
接下来，我们要使用一种更加现代化的技术栈 

12616
12:45:52,000 --> 12:45:55,390
which is a more modern stack to build our websites here. 
"Nextjs / Reactjs" 来构建我们的网站

12617
12:45:55,420 --> 12:45:57,220
But learning understanding how to do everything with HTML and JavaScript first, 
但首先来学习和理解如何使用 HTML 和 JavaScript 来完成所有的操作

12618
12:45:57,220 --> 12:46:01,270
is going to make our lives a lot easier come later on down the road. 
会让我们之后的学习工作变得更轻松一些

12619
12:46:01,270 --> 12:46:05,440
But as we know, all websites use HTML as kind of their scaffolding for what they look like. 
但正如我们所知的，所有网站都使用 HTML 作为它们的骨架来支撑外观

12620
12:46:05,560 --> 12:46:08,620
So let's go ahead and create our HTML for our website, 
所以让我们继续，来为我们的网站创建一个 HTML 文件

12621
12:46:08,620 --> 12:46:12,610
we'll call it index dot HTML. 
我们把它命名为 "index.html" 

12622
12:46:12,640 --> 12:46:17,680
And this is going to be the basic scaffolding or the


12623
12:46:17,680 --> 12:46:21,130
basic bones of what our website is going to look like. Now, in


12624
12:46:21,130 --> 12:46:24,940
VS code, if you go ahead and just type exclamation mark index


12625
12:46:24,940 --> 12:46:28,240
dot HTML, and you click the first thing that pops up, it'll


12626
12:46:28,270 --> 12:46:32,350
automatically populate your code your file here with some basic


12627
12:46:32,380 --> 12:46:36,760
HTML setup. If it doesn't do this for you, feel free to copy


12628
12:46:36,760 --> 12:46:40,360
paste the basic setup from the GitHub repository associated


12629
12:46:40,360 --> 12:46:43,840
with this course, we have our doctype. HTML, we have some HTML


12630
12:46:43,840 --> 12:46:46,600
tags telling us that everything in between here is going to be


12631
12:46:46,660 --> 12:46:49,600
an HTML, which is great. However, for simplicity, we


12632
12:46:49,600 --> 12:46:51,550
don't need most of this. So we're going to make this a


12633
12:46:51,550 --> 12:46:54,160
little bit easier. We're going to delete this line, this line


12634
12:46:54,160 --> 12:46:56,950
and this line. And we're just going to change the title to


12635
12:46:57,220 --> 12:47:01,090
fund me app. And then inside of our body, we can do something


12636
12:47:01,090 --> 12:47:05,410
like or Hello. And now we have the bare bones to create a


12637
12:47:05,410 --> 12:47:09,160
website just with this. Now to show this on a website, we can


12638
12:47:09,160 --> 12:47:12,040
do one of two things. If you are using Visual Studio code, I'm


12639
12:47:12,040 --> 12:47:16,240
going to recommend you install the extension live server. And


12640
12:47:16,240 --> 12:47:18,610
it looks like this. And I'll have the extension ID for this


12641
12:47:18,610 --> 12:47:21,310
extension in the GitHub repository associated with this


12642
12:47:21,310 --> 12:47:23,920
course, this is going to allow us to easily spin up an HTML


12643
12:47:23,920 --> 12:47:27,070
website. So we'll go ahead and install this. And if you're not


12644
12:47:27,070 --> 12:47:29,890
using Visual Studio Code, I'll show you a different way in just


12645
12:47:29,890 --> 12:47:33,340
a second. Once this is installed, you should have this


12646
12:47:33,340 --> 12:47:36,880
little go live button at the bottom. And if you don't, you


12647
12:47:36,880 --> 12:47:39,460
can always open up your command palette, which again, you can


12648
12:47:39,460 --> 12:47:43,240
open up by hitting View command palette, and you can type in


12649
12:47:43,270 --> 12:47:46,810
live server and just say open with live server but we're going


12650
12:47:46,810 --> 12:47:49,240
to just click this go live button. And it's going to say


12651
12:47:49,240 --> 12:47:53,680
starting and it's actually going to open up your browser with our


12652
12:47:53,710 --> 12:47:57,460
index dot HTML. We can actually see our website is being called


12653
12:47:57,490 --> 12:48:02,500
Save on 120 7.0 point 0.1. This is known as the loopback, or


12654
12:48:02,530 --> 12:48:06,430
local host endpoint, we're on port 5501. If you're not


12655
12:48:06,430 --> 12:48:09,010
familiar with the ports, don't worry about that for now, we


12656
12:48:09,010 --> 12:48:12,310
have our index dot HTML here. And if we change this to


12657
12:48:12,340 --> 12:48:16,630
something like what's good, we hit save. If it doesn't


12658
12:48:16,630 --> 12:48:19,060
automatically refresh, we'd come over here and refresh. And we'd


12659
12:48:19,060 --> 12:48:21,640
see that being reflected here. If you've never created a


12660
12:48:21,640 --> 12:48:23,980
website before, you've essentially just done it,


12661
12:48:24,040 --> 12:48:28,150
congratulations, you might get this.vs code folder. a.vs code


12662
12:48:28,180 --> 12:48:32,680
folder allows you to make settings specifically for the


12663
12:48:32,680 --> 12:48:35,530
repo that you're working with, for your code editor for VS


12664
12:48:35,530 --> 12:48:38,740
code, but we're going to mostly ignore it for now. Now, if


12665
12:48:38,740 --> 12:48:41,680
you're not using Visual Studio Code, what you can do is you can


12666
12:48:41,680 --> 12:48:45,610
just run this in the browser. So one thing you could do is you


12667
12:48:45,610 --> 12:48:48,340
could right click it, and I'm using a Mac. So I'm going to hit


12668
12:48:48,340 --> 12:48:52,270
Reveal in Finder, aka reveal where it's located. And you can


12669
12:48:52,270 --> 12:48:54,970
just double click it, and boom, now it's running right in your


12670
12:48:54,970 --> 12:48:57,790
browser. Instead of pointing to your localhost, it's going to be


12671
12:48:57,790 --> 12:49:01,660
pointing directly to your local file path. Now one final version


12672
12:49:01,660 --> 12:49:03,970
that we could do that I'm going to highly recommend you don't


12673
12:49:03,970 --> 12:49:06,850
do. But it's another option, we're actually going to download


12674
12:49:06,850 --> 12:49:10,180
a package for you using no Jas, which allows us to serve up


12675
12:49:10,210 --> 12:49:12,910
HTTP. And we're gonna install it the exact same way we've


12676
12:49:12,910 --> 12:49:17,620
installed our other packages, we can do yarn, add dash dash dev


12677
12:49:17,680 --> 12:49:22,870
HTTP hyphen server. And you may still want to add it anyways.


12678
12:49:22,900 --> 12:49:26,470
But now, we'll get some node modules for this HTTP server


12679
12:49:26,470 --> 12:49:30,010
package, we'll get a package json, and of course, a yarn dot


12680
12:49:30,010 --> 12:49:34,180
lock as well. And what we can do is we can stop this down here,


12681
12:49:34,210 --> 12:49:36,940
stop that live server. And if we go back to our website, refresh,


12682
12:49:37,240 --> 12:49:42,400
it'll now be blank. And we can run yarn HTTP server. And this


12683
12:49:42,400 --> 12:49:45,670
will do the exact same thing. And we get, and if we come over,


12684
12:49:45,730 --> 12:49:49,060
and we refresh, we'll see what's good. Now this one is a little


12685
12:49:49,060 --> 12:49:52,900
bit more finicky. And after you make a change, like, Hey, what's


12686
12:49:52,900 --> 12:49:56,200
good, you might have to close it, and then reopen it and then


12687
12:49:56,200 --> 12:50:00,100
refresh. So I do recommend that if you're on Visual Studio code,


12688
12:50:00,280 --> 12:50:02,590
you definitely just use this little go live button, because


12689
12:50:02,590 --> 12:50:04,390
it'll reflect your changes a lot nicer.


12690
12:50:04,420 --> 12:50:07,000
So let's go ahead and hit the Go Live button. Hey, what's good


12691
12:50:07,000 --> 12:50:10,000
pops up. Okay, cool. Our HTML is working perfectly.
