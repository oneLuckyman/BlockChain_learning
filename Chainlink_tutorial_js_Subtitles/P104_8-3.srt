12611
12:45:32,260 --> 12:45:38,920
So in here, let's make a quick readme.md. 
现在，让我们来快速创建一个 "README.md" 文件

12612
12:45:38,920 --> 12:45:40,990
Just so we can talk about what we're going to be making here. 
这样我们就可以讨论一下接下来我们要处理的内容

12613
12:45:40,990 --> 12:45:44,620
So in this section, we're gonna be using raw HTML slash JavaScript 
在这一节中，我们将先使用原始的 "HTML / JavaScript" 

12614
12:45:44,620 --> 12:45:47,470
in conjunction with our smart contracts to build this website.
结合我们的智能合约来构建这个网站

12615
12:45:47,590 --> 12:45:52,000
Later on. We will use next Jas slash react, 
接下来，我们要使用一种更加现代化的技术栈 

12616
12:45:52,000 --> 12:45:55,390
which is a more modern stack to build our websites here. 
"Nextjs / Reactjs" 来构建我们的网站

12617
12:45:55,420 --> 12:45:57,220
But learning understanding how to do everything with HTML and JavaScript first, 
但首先来学习和理解如何使用 HTML 和 JavaScript 来完成所有的操作

12618
12:45:57,220 --> 12:46:01,270
is going to make our lives a lot easier come later on down the road. 
会让我们之后的学习工作变得更轻松一些

12619
12:46:01,270 --> 12:46:05,440
But as we know, all websites use HTML as kind of their scaffolding for what they look like. 
但正如我们所知的，所有网站都使用 HTML 作为它们的骨架来支撑外观

12620
12:46:05,560 --> 12:46:08,620
So let's go ahead and create our HTML for our website, 
所以让我们继续，来为我们的网站创建一个 HTML 文件

12621
12:46:08,620 --> 12:46:12,610
we'll call it index dot HTML. 
我们把它命名为 "index.html" 

12622
12:46:12,640 --> 12:46:17,680
And this is going to be the basic scaffolding or the basic bones of what our website is going to look like. 
这将是我们网站的基本骨架，它决定了网站的基本结构和外观

12623
12:46:17,680 --> 12:46:21,130
Now, in VS code, if you go ahead and just type exclamation mark index dot HTML, 
现在到 VS Code 中，如果你在 "index.html" 中输入一个感叹号("!") 

12624
12:46:21,130 --> 12:46:24,940
and you click the first thing that pops up, 
然后点击弹出来的第一项

12625
12:46:24,940 --> 12:46:28,240
it'll automatically populate your code your file here with some basic HTML setup. 
它就会自动在你的代码文件中填充一些基本的 HTML 设置

12626
12:46:28,270 --> 12:46:32,350
If it doesn't do this for you, 
如果它并不适合你

12627
12:46:32,380 --> 12:46:36,760
feel free to copy paste the basic setup from the GitHub repository associated with this course, 
那么你可以复制粘贴课程关联的 GitHub 仓库中的基本设置

12628
12:46:36,760 --> 12:46:40,360
we have our doctype. HTML, 
我们有 `<!DOCTYPE html>`

12629
12:46:40,360 --> 12:46:43,840
we have some HTML tags telling us that everything in between here is going to be an HTML, 
还有一些 HTML 标签，告诉我们这里的所有内容都是 HTML

12630
12:46:43,840 --> 12:46:46,600
which is great. 
非常好

12631
12:46:46,660 --> 12:46:49,600
However, for simplicity, we don't need most of this. 
然而，为了简单起见，我们并不需要其中的大多数内容

12632
12:46:49,600 --> 12:46:51,550
So we're going to make this a little bit easier. 
所以我们要让它变得更简单一些

12633
12:46:51,550 --> 12:46:54,160
We're going to delete this line, this line and this line. 
我们要删除这一行，这一行，还有这一行

12634
12:46:54,160 --> 12:46:56,950
And we're just going to change the title to fund me app. 
然后直接把标题改成 "Fund Me App" 

12635
12:46:57,220 --> 12:47:01,090
And then inside of our body, we can do something like or Hello. 
接着在 `<body>` 内部，我们可以输入，比如说 `Hello!`

12636
12:47:01,090 --> 12:47:05,410
And now we have the bare bones to create a website just with this. 
现在我们就有了创建网站的基本骨架了，就是现在这些

12637
12:47:05,410 --> 12:47:09,160
Now to show this on a website, we can do one of two things. 
现在，要想把它展示到网站上，我们有两种方法可以选择

12638
12:47:09,160 --> 12:47:12,040
If you are using Visual Studio code, 
如果你使用的是 Visual Studio Code 

12639
12:47:12,040 --> 12:47:16,240
I'm going to recommend you install the extension live server. And it looks like this. 
那么我建议你安装扩展 "live server"，就是这个

12640
12:47:16,240 --> 12:47:18,610
And I'll have the extension ID for this extension in the GitHub repository associated with this course, 
我会把这个扩展的 ID 放到课程关联的 GitHub 仓库中

12641
12:47:18,610 --> 12:47:21,310
this is going to allow us to easily spin up an HTML website. 
它可以让我们非常轻松的打开一个 HTML 网站

12642
12:47:21,310 --> 12:47:23,920
So we'll go ahead and install this. 
所以我们继续，把它安装上

12643
12:47:23,920 --> 12:47:27,070
And if you're not using Visual Studio Code, 
如果你不使用 Visual Studio Code 

12644
12:47:27,070 --> 12:47:29,890
I'll show you a different way in just a second. 
那么我稍后会向你展示一种不同的方式

12645
12:47:29,890 --> 12:47:33,340
Once this is installed, you should have this little go live button at the bottom. 
把这个安装好以后，你在底部就应该会有这么一个小的 "Go Live" 按钮

12646
12:47:33,340 --> 12:47:36,880
And if you don't, you can always open up your command palette, 
如果没有的话，你总可以通过打开你的命令面板

12647
12:47:36,880 --> 12:47:39,460
which again, you can open up by hitting View command palette, 
再次提醒，你可以通过点击查看("View")来打开命令面板("Command Palette") 

12648
12:47:39,460 --> 12:47:43,240
and you can type in live server 
然后你可以输入 "live server" 

12649
12:47:43,270 --> 12:47:46,810
and just say open with live server 
然后选择 "Open with Live Server"

12650
12:47:46,810 --> 12:47:49,240
but we're going to just click this go live button. 
但我们这里就直接点击这个 "Go Live" 按钮了

12651
12:47:49,240 --> 12:47:53,680
And it's going to say starting 
然后它就会显示 "Starting"

12652
12:47:53,710 --> 12:47:57,460
and it's actually going to open up your browser with our index dot HTML. 
接着它就会打开你的浏览器，使用的就是我们的 "index.html"

12653
12:47:57,490 --> 12:48:02,500
We can actually see our website is being called Save on 120 7.0 point 0.1. 
我们可以看到，我们的网站托管在了 "127.0.0.1"

12654
12:48:02,530 --> 12:48:06,430
This is known as the loopback, or local host endpoint, we're on port 5501. 
这就是所谓的“回环”("loopback")或者说本地主机端点("local host endpoint")，我们位于端口 5501

12655
12:48:06,430 --> 12:48:09,010
If you're not familiar with the ports, don't worry about that for now, 
如果对端口("port")并不熟悉，暂时也不用担心

12656
12:48:09,010 --> 12:48:12,310
we have our index dot HTML here. 
总之我们这里已经有了我们的 "index.html" 了

12657
12:48:12,340 --> 12:48:16,630
And if we change this to something like what's good, we hit save. 
如果我们将其更改为，比如说 "Whats good?"，点击保存

12658
12:48:16,630 --> 12:48:19,060
If it doesn't automatically refresh, we'd come over here and refresh. 
如果它没有自动刷新，我们可以到这边来刷新一下

12659
12:48:19,060 --> 12:48:21,640
And we'd see that being reflected here. 
并且我们可以看到它已经反映在这里了

12660
12:48:21,640 --> 12:48:23,980
If you've never created a website before, you've essentially just done it, congratulations, 
如果你以前从来没创建过网站的话，那么你现在已经基本上做到了，恭喜你

12661
12:48:24,040 --> 12:48:28,150
you might get this.vs code folder. 
你可能会获得这么一个 ".vscode" 文件夹

12662
12:48:28,180 --> 12:48:32,680
a.vs code folder allows you to make settings specifically for the repo that you're working with, 
这个 ".vscode" 文件夹允许你对正在使用的代码库进行专门的设置

12663
12:48:32,680 --> 12:48:35,530
for your code editor for VS code, 
它适用于 VS Code 代码编辑器

12664
12:48:35,530 --> 12:48:38,740
but we're going to mostly ignore it for now. 
但我们现在暂时会忽略掉它

12665
12:48:38,740 --> 12:48:41,680
Now, if you're not using Visual Studio Code, 
现在，如果你使用的不是 Visual Studio Code 

12666
12:48:41,680 --> 12:48:45,610
what you can do is you can just run this in the browser. 
那么你可以直接在浏览器中运行这个文件

12667
12:48:45,610 --> 12:48:48,340
So one thing you could do is you could right click it, and I'm using a Mac. So I'm going to hit Reveal in Finder, 
你可以右键点击它，我用的是 Mac，所以我选择的是“在 Finder 中显示”

12668
12:48:48,340 --> 12:48:52,270
aka reveal where it's located. 
也就是显示它在本地的位置

12669
12:48:52,270 --> 12:48:54,970
And you can just double click it, and boom, now it's running right in your browser. 
接着，你可以直接双击打开它，嘭，它已经在你的浏览器中运行了

12670
12:48:54,970 --> 12:48:57,790
Instead of pointing to your localhost, it's going to be pointing directly to your local file path. 
只不过不是指向你的本地主机，而是直接指向你的本地文件路径

12671
12:48:57,790 --> 12:49:01,660
Now one final version that we could do 
这里还有一个最终方案可以使用

12672
12:49:01,660 --> 12:49:03,970
that I'm going to highly recommend you don't do. 
但我强烈推荐你不要这么做

12673
12:49:03,970 --> 12:49:06,850
But it's another option, 
不过这也是一种选择

12674
12:49:06,850 --> 12:49:10,180
we're actually going to download a package for you using no Jas, which allows us to serve up HTTP. 
我们要为你的 node.js 下载一个包，这个包允许你使用 HTTP 服务

12675
12:49:10,210 --> 12:49:12,910
And we're gonna install it the exact same way we've installed our other packages, 
安装它的方法就和安装其它包完全一样

12676
12:49:12,910 --> 12:49:17,620
we can do yarn, add dash dash dev HTTP hyphen server. 
我们要执行 `yarn add --dev http-server`

12677
12:49:17,680 --> 12:49:22,870
And you may still want to add it anyways.
你可能仍然想要添加它

12678
12:49:22,900 --> 12:49:26,470
But now, we'll get some node modules for this HTTP server package, 
但是现在，我们要获取一些用于这个 "http-server" 的 node 模块。

12679
12:49:26,470 --> 12:49:30,010
we'll get a package json, and of course, a yarn dot lock as well. 
我们获得了 "package.json"，当然了，还有 "yarn.lock"

12680
12:49:30,010 --> 12:49:34,180
And what we can do is we can stop this down here, stop that live server. 
我们先中断这里的 "Live Server" 

12681
12:49:34,210 --> 12:49:36,940
And if we go back to our website, refresh, it'll now be blank. 
回到我们的网站，刷新，它现在是空的了

12682
12:49:37,240 --> 12:49:42,400
And we can run yarn HTTP server. 
然后我们运行 `yarn http-server`

12683
12:49:42,400 --> 12:49:45,670
And this will do the exact same thing. 
它做的就是完全相同的事

12684
12:49:45,730 --> 12:49:49,060
And we get, and if we come over, and we refresh, we'll see what's good. 
如果我们转到这边，刷新一下，就会看到 "Whats good?"

12685
12:49:49,060 --> 12:49:52,900
Now this one is a little bit more finicky. 
这个有点麻烦的是

12686
12:49:52,900 --> 12:49:56,200
And after you make a change, like, Hey, what's good, 
当你做了一些修改后，比如说 "Hey whats good?"

12687
12:49:56,200 --> 12:50:00,100
you might have to close it, and then reopen it and then refresh. 
你可能需要先关掉它，然后重新打开，然后再刷新

12688
12:50:00,280 --> 12:50:02,590
So I do recommend that if you're on Visual Studio code, you definitely just use this little go live button, 
所以我建议，如果你用的是 Visual Studio Code，那么你可以直接使用这个小的 "Go Live" 按钮

12689
12:50:02,590 --> 12:50:04,390
because it'll reflect your changes a lot nicer. 
因为它可以更好地反映你的更改

12690
12:50:04,420 --> 12:50:07,000
So let's go ahead and hit the Go Live button. Hey, what's good pops up. 
所以我们继续，点击 "Go Live" 按钮，"Hey whats good" 弹了出来

12691
12:50:07,000 --> 12:50:10,000
Okay, cool. Our HTML is working perfectly. 
OK，酷~ 我们的 HTML 正在完美运行
