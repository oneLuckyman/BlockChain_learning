7009
06:55:13,570 --> 06:55:16,060
So now we have our simple storage. That's all compiled,
现在我们已经把 "SimpleStorage" 编译好了

7010
06:55:16,330 --> 06:55:19,750
let's learn how we can actually deploy this thing. 
现在我们来学习一下如何部署它

7011
06:55:19,750 --> 06:55:22,780
Remember, in remix, we actually deployed it to one of two different places,
在 Remix 里，其实我们可以把它部署到两个不同的地方

7012
06:55:22,900 --> 06:55:27,250
we deployed it to either a JavaScript VM, 
我们可以把它部署到 "JavaScript VM" 

7013
06:55:27,250 --> 06:55:31,180
or with our injected web three, with our Metamask. 
或是 "Injected Web3" ，也就是 Metamask 上

7014
06:55:31,180 --> 06:55:34,450
Let's learn first ad, do the JavaScript VM. 
我们先来学习怎么部署到 "JavaScript VM" 上

7015
06:55:34,450 --> 06:55:38,410
And then we'll learn how to use the injected web three, 
之后再学习如何部署到 "Injected Web3" 上

7016
06:55:38,410 --> 06:55:41,530
or a meta mask or some connection to an actual test net. 
也可以说是 Metamask 或者任何真实的测试网络上

7017
06:55:41,530 --> 06:55:44,710
So in order to deploy this to a JavaScript virtual invite I'm in or kind of a fake blockchain, 
为了部署这个到 JavaScript 虚拟机环境或者说假的区块链上

7018
06:55:44,710 --> 06:55:48,190
we're gonna need to get a fake blockchain. 
我们需要先拥有一个假的区块链

7019
06:55:48,190 --> 06:55:51,550
Now in the future, we're going to be using the Hardhead runtime environment 
未来，我们将会使用 Hardhat 运行环境

7020
06:55:51,550 --> 06:55:55,810
as our JavaScript virtual machine or aka our fake blockchain. 
作为我们的 JavaScript 虚拟机或者说假的区块链

7021
06:55:55,810 --> 06:55:59,440
But for this section, I want us to use a tool called ganache. 
但在本节中，我想用的是一个叫做 "Ganache" 的工具

7022
06:55:59,440 --> 06:56:02,320
There's a link to this in the GitHub repository. 
可以通过 GitHub 仓库中的链接跳转到这里

7023
06:56:02,320 --> 06:56:06,220
Ganache is similar to a virtual machine in remix. 
Ganache 和 Remix 里的虚拟机很相似

7024
06:56:06,220 --> 06:56:10,390
It's a fake blockchain that we can run locally 
这是一个我们可以在本地运行的假区块链

7025
06:56:10,390 --> 06:56:14,200
to actually test, deploy and run code. 
可以供我们进行测试，部署还有运行代码

7026
06:56:14,200 --> 06:56:17,500
It's also a nice way to see things that are going on in a blockchain. 
这也是观察区块链上正在发生的事情的一个好方法。

7027
06:56:17,500 --> 06:56:20,320
Let's go ahead and spin up the ganache application after you install it, 
你需要先安装 Ganache 然后我们就可以启动它了

7028
06:56:20,320 --> 06:56:24,220
the ganache application will look a little something like this. 
应用程序 Ganache 看起来就是这样的

7029
06:56:24,220 --> 06:56:28,150
And to spin up a fake blockchain really quickly, ou can just go ahead and click Quickstart. 
用它启动一个假区块链真的很快，你只需要点击一下 "QUICKSTART"

7030
06:56:28,150 --> 06:56:31,390
This will spin up a fake blockchain that's running locally on your computer right here, which is fantastic. 
它就会在你的计算机本地启动一个假区块链，真是太酷了

7031
06:56:31,390 --> 06:56:35,170
It comes with a whole bunch of fake accounts 
它带有一大堆假账户

7032
06:56:35,170 --> 06:56:39,370
exactly like how remix comes with a ton of fake accounts with 100 ether each 
就和 Remix 上每个带有 100 ETH 的假账户完全一样

7033
06:56:39,370 --> 06:56:42,940
ganache comes with a bunch of fake accounts with 100 ether each. 
Ganache 同样的带有一大堆假账户并且每个也有 100 ETH

7034
06:56:42,940 --> 06:56:46,750
They also come with the private keys 
它们还附有私钥

7035
06:56:46,750 --> 06:56:50,770
that we can use in our applications to actually take control of these fake accounts. 
这可以让我们在应用程序中控制这些假账户

7036
06:56:50,800 --> 06:56:54,310
Remember, don't use these private keys on a public blockchain. 
记住，不要在公共区块链上使用这些私钥

7037
06:56:54,310 --> 06:56:56,620
They're for development purposes only 
它们仅用于开发目的

7038
06:56:56,620 --> 06:56:59,530
because a lot of people know these private keys 
因为很多人都知道这些私钥

7039
06:56:59,530 --> 06:57:02,710
in our code. One of the first things that we're going to need to do 
在我们的代码中，我们首先要做的就是

7040
06:57:02,710 --> 06:57:05,440
is actually connect to our blockchain 
连接到我们的区块链上

7041
06:57:05,440 --> 06:57:09,100
remix does this a little bit behind the scenes, 
Remix 在幕后完成了这一工作

7042
06:57:09,100 --> 06:57:12,160
if we're choosing JavaScript virtual machine 
如果我们选择 JavaScript 虚拟机

7043
06:57:12,160 --> 06:57:15,760
remix chooses its own fake blockchain that it runs. 
Remix 就会选择它自己运行的假区块链

7044
06:57:15,760 --> 06:57:19,420
If we choose injected web three, as we know, meta mask pops up, 
如果我们选择了 "Injected Web3"，如我们所料 Metamask 弹了出来

7045
06:57:19,420 --> 06:57:22,120
and it connects to our meta mask, 
它连接到了我们的 Metamask 上

7046
06:57:22,120 --> 06:57:25,600
this connection that remix does, is actually doing something really interesting. 
Remix 所做的这种连接，其实是一件很有意思的事

7047
06:57:25,600 --> 06:57:29,140
It's not just connecting to our meta mask by some magical powers. 
它不是通过某种魔法力量连接到了我们的 Metamask

7048
06:57:29,140 --> 06:57:32,530
It's actually connecting to our meta mask, which has a connection to the blockchain behind the scenes. 
而是通过在幕后与区块链连接从而连接到了我们的 Metamask 

7049
06:57:32,560 --> 06:57:36,040
If you open up your meta mask, 
如果你打开 Metamask

7050
06:57:36,040 --> 06:57:39,580
and you go down to you select the networks and you select ad networks,
然后打开网络选项("Networks")选择添加网络("Add Network")

7051
06:57:40,000 --> 06:57:43,570
you'll get popped up into a UI that looks like this. 
就会弹出一个像是这样的 UI 界面

7052
06:57:43,570 --> 06:57:47,530
If we go back and hit select networks over here, 
如果你点击这里返回到“网络”("Networks")选项界面

7053
06:57:47,650 --> 06:57:50,290
we can actually see information about these different networks. 
我们就可以看到这些不同网络的一系列信息

7054
06:57:50,290 --> 06:57:53,230
One of the main things that we can see 
我们能看到的主要内容之一是

7055
06:57:53,260 --> 06:57:58,480
is that all these networks have something called an RPC URL. 
所有网络都有一个叫做 "RPC URL" 的东西

7056
06:57:58,480 --> 06:58:03,820
RPC stands for remote procedure call. 
RPC 表示“远程过程调用”("Remote Procedure call") 

7057
06:58:04,030 --> 06:58:07,750
And then URL is uniform resource locator. 
而 URL 则是“统一资源定位符”("Uniform Resource Locator")

7058
06:58:07,750 --> 06:58:12,370
This RPC URL stands for a connection to a blockchain node that somebody is running 
这个 "RPC URL" 代表，到某人正在运行的区块链节点("Blockchain node")的连接

7059
06:58:12,370 --> 06:58:15,790
this this URL connects us to make API calls and to interact with a blockchain node. 
这个 URL 连接我们进行 API 的调用以及与区块链节点的交互

7060
06:58:15,790 --> 06:58:19,810
Blockchain nodes run with software, and some of them expose an API call. 
区块链节点使用软件运行，其中的一些会公开 API 调用

7061
06:58:19,810 --> 06:58:23,590
If you look at the NGO Aetherium website, there actually are instructions


7062
06:58:23,620 --> 06:58:26,560
for you to run your own blockchain node for a real


7063
06:58:26,560 --> 06:58:30,370
blockchain like Aetherium. Most of these have flags like dash


7064
06:58:30,370 --> 06:58:36,250
HTTP dot ADR to expose these RPC endpoints. So if you ever want


7065
06:58:36,250 --> 06:58:39,430
to run your own node, your own real blockchain node, instead of


7066
06:58:39,430 --> 06:58:42,250
using meta masks or any other the providers that we're going


7067
06:58:42,250 --> 06:58:44,410
to go through, you can use go Aetherium, or whatever


7068
06:58:44,410 --> 06:58:47,080
blockchain you're working with software to run your own notes.


7069
06:58:47,110 --> 06:58:50,770
But it's this RPC URL that allows us to connect to Rinkeby,


7070
06:58:50,800 --> 06:58:54,730
if on Rinkeby ropsten, if we're on ropsten main net if we're on


7071
06:58:54,730 --> 06:58:57,550
Main net, etc. And it's going to be the way that we're going to


7072
06:58:57,550 --> 06:59:01,210
connect to our ganache blockchain that we're running


7073
06:59:01,270 --> 06:59:04,660
inside of this application. So if you look at the top of your


7074
06:59:04,660 --> 06:59:08,710
ganache here, there's a section called the RPC server. And this


7075
06:59:08,710 --> 06:59:11,830
is the endpoint of our ganache node right now. So what we can


7076
06:59:11,830 --> 06:59:16,420
do is we can copy this and go back to our VS code, and paste


7077
06:59:16,420 --> 06:59:20,110
it in here to see if we can connect instead of HTTP. With


7078
06:59:20,110 --> 06:59:22,240
these capitals, we're gonna have a B lowercase instead of the


7079
06:59:22,270 --> 06:59:25,270
uppercase, because the lowercase is more correct, and it looks


7080
06:59:25,270 --> 06:59:27,910
nicer. But now we have the endpoint. Hypothetically, with


7081
06:59:27,910 --> 06:59:31,870
just this, we can start making calls and API calls to this


7082
06:59:31,870 --> 06:59:35,740
endpoint, go to this JSON RPC specification. Again, link will


7083
06:59:35,740 --> 06:59:38,950
be in the GitHub repo, we can actually see different calls we


7084
06:59:38,950 --> 06:59:42,310
can make directly to our node to get different information. eath


7085
06:59:42,310 --> 06:59:45,910
get blocked by hash eath get blocked by number. And all of


7086
06:59:45,910 --> 06:59:49,450
these wonderful pieces in here. Making these API calls directly


7087
06:59:49,450 --> 06:59:52,630
is is a little bit annoying to do ourselves. If you want to do


7088
06:59:52,630 --> 06:59:56,680
it yourself, you absolutely can using an API endpoint like Axios


7089
06:59:56,770 --> 06:59:59,560
or fetch. However, we're going to use a rapper to interact with


7090
06:59:59,560 --> 07:00:02,710
our node and do things like deploy and interact and other


7091
07:00:02,710 --> 07:00:06,280
such things with our blockchain node. This is finally where


7092
07:00:06,460 --> 07:00:07,420
ethers comes


7093
07:00:07,420 --> 07:00:13,780
into play.
