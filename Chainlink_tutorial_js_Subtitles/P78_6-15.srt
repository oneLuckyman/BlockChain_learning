9785
09:47:35,500 --> 09:47:41,200
Alright, the next part of this section, I'm actually going to go over the TypeScript edition of this. 
好的，本节的下一部分，我就真的要向你展示这个的 TypeScript 版本了

9786
09:47:41,200 --> 09:47:43,750
But for all intents and purposes, you've successfully created your first Hardhead project, 
但不管怎么讲，你都已经成功创建了你的第一个 Hardhat 项目了

9787
09:47:43,750 --> 09:47:46,330
you've done a ton of amazing things. In this lesson, 
你已经在这节课中完成了许多了不起的事情了

9788
09:47:46,330 --> 09:47:50,620
let's do a quick refresher of what we've learned so far, 
现在让我们快速回顾一下目前为止我们学到的内容

9789
09:47:50,620 --> 09:47:53,560
we learned how to spin up our own hard hat projects.
我们学习了如何启动我们的 Hardhat 项目

9790
09:47:53,560 --> 09:47:57,100
And now we can run yarn, hard hat 
现在我们可以运行 "yarn hardhat"

9791
09:47:57,340 --> 09:48:02,620
and see a list of the tasks and different things that we can do with hard hat. 
并查看可以使用 Hardhat 执行的 task 以及其他操作的列表

9792
09:48:02,650 --> 09:48:06,010
We learned that hard hat looks for this hard hat.config.js. 
我们知道了 Hardhat 会寻找这个 "hardhat.config.js"

9793
09:48:06,010 --> 09:48:10,210
And this is sort of the entry point for any task that we run that starts with hard hat, 
这是我们运行任何以 "hardhat" 开头的 task 的入口

9794
09:48:10,210 --> 09:48:13,330
we learned we can add our contracts to this contracts folder. 
我们学习了可以添加我们的合约到这个 "contracts" 文件夹

9795
09:48:13,330 --> 09:48:16,150
And then we compile it by running yarn, art half compile, 
然后可以执行 "yarn hardhat compile" 来编译它

9796
09:48:16,150 --> 09:48:20,020
we learned that all the compliation goes into the artifacts and then the cache as well. 
我们学习了所有的编译结果都会存放在 "artifacts" 和 "cache" 中

9797
09:48:20,020 --> 09:48:24,400
And if we want to clean reset, we can either delete these two files 
并且如果我们想清空和重置，那么可以删除这两个文件

9798
09:48:24,400 --> 09:48:28,210
or just run yarn, hard hat clean. 
或是执行 "yarn hardhat clean"

9799
09:48:28,210 --> 09:48:30,820
So we learned that we can use scripts or tasks 
我们还学习了如何使用脚本和 task 

9800
09:48:30,820 --> 09:48:34,840
to actually deploy, interact and do things with our smart contracts. 
来部署，交互和处理我们的智能合约

9801
09:48:34,870 --> 09:48:38,350
We also learned that I'm going to be using scripts for the rest of this course. 
我们还学到了在这个课程的剩余部分我都将使用脚本

9802
09:48:38,350 --> 09:48:40,990
But if you want, you could absolutely use tasks as well. 
但如果你想的话，也完全可以使用 task

9803
09:48:40,990 --> 09:48:43,360
I've asked this question a million times what's the difference? 
我已经问过了无数次这二者有什么区别

9804
09:48:43,360 --> 09:48:46,360
Nobody really seems to know what the main difference is. 
但似乎没有人真正知道它们的主要区别是什么

9805
09:48:46,360 --> 09:48:49,060
But I think the main difference is that tasks are for plugins. 
不过我认为主要区别是 task 用于插件

9806
09:48:49,060 --> 09:48:51,760
And scripts are for your local development Mart, that is mind limiter, 
而脚本用于你的本地开发模式，这是我的看法

9807
09:48:51,760 --> 09:48:54,220
we learned that we can import a whole bunch of things, 
我们还学习了可以导入这么一大堆东西到我们的脚本中

9808
09:48:54,220 --> 09:48:57,280
including tasks from hard hat in our scripts, 
其中就包括 Hardhat 的 task 

9809
09:48:57,280 --> 09:49:01,120
and we can work with our async functions to grab our contracts and deploy them, 
并且我们可以使用异步函数来获取我们的合约并部署它们

9810
09:49:01,150 --> 09:49:03,610
we actually then can programmatically verify them using hard hat and using hard hat plugins. 
我们还可以使用 Hardhat 和 Hardhat 的插件来程序化地验证它们

9811
09:49:03,610 --> 09:49:07,390
And then additionally, we can interact with our contracts very similar to how we did it with ethers. 
此外我们还可以使用与 ethers 非常相似的方法与合约进行交互

9812
09:49:07,390 --> 09:49:11,410
We wrote a wonderful verification script. 
我们编写了一个非常棒的验证脚本

9813
09:49:11,410 --> 09:49:14,230
And we also wrote our own task, 
还编写了一个我们自己的 task 

9814
09:49:14,230 --> 09:49:17,260
we wrote our first test for this whole space. 
我们为整个空间编写了第一个测试

9815
09:49:17,260 --> 09:49:20,560
And we showed what our tests are going to look like moving forward. 
并展示了我们未来的测试形式

9816
09:49:20,560 --> 09:49:24,790
And we talked a little bit about their importance. 
我们还稍微谈了点测试的重要性

9817
09:49:24,790 --> 09:49:27,400
And I really should stress that 
并且我十分强调

9818
09:49:27,400 --> 09:49:30,520
writing good tests is going to be the difference between a really professional environment and kind of a side project. 
是否编写了一个好的测试是一个项目专业还是业余的主要区别

9819
09:49:30,520 --> 09:49:33,430
Whenever I audit smart contracts, 
每当我审计智能合约时

9820
09:49:33,430 --> 09:49:35,860
or whenever I'm given a project for someone to tell me to take a look at. 
或是每当有人给我一个项目让我去瞧一瞧的时候

9821
09:49:36,010 --> 09:49:38,920
The first thing I look at is the readme, of course. 
我的第一件事是阅读 README，这是当然的了

9822
09:49:38,920 --> 09:49:41,860
And the second thing I look at is the tests. 
而第二件事就是查看它的测试

9823
09:49:41,860 --> 09:49:44,950
And if tests aren't good, I usually tell them, 
如果测试写的不好，我就会告诉他们

9824
09:49:45,010 --> 09:49:48,850
hey, you need to go back to the drawing board, and you need to level up your tests.
嘿，你得重头开始，并且提升一下你的测试水平

9825
09:49:48,850 --> 09:49:51,640
So tests are really really important, especially for this space, 
因此测试非常非常的重要，尤其是对这个领域来说

9826
09:49:51,640 --> 09:49:54,460
we learned about a couple of more environment variables we can use. 
我们还学习了另外几个可用的环境变量

9827
09:49:54,490 --> 09:49:57,040
We learned about a couple of tools to see how good our tests are one of them being coverage. 
以及几个用于检查测试质量的工具，其中一个是 "coverage"

9828
09:49:57,040 --> 09:50:00,040
We also learn about a gas reporter 
我们还学习了有关 "gas-reporter" 的内容

9829
09:50:00,040 --> 09:50:03,070
to see how much it's going to cost us when we actually deploy to a real network. 
它可以查看我们在实际网络上进行部署时的花费

9830
09:50:03,100 --> 09:50:07,060
We learned a ton about the hard hat config, 
我们学习了大量有关 "hardhat.config" 的知识

9831
09:50:07,060 --> 09:50:10,450
and how there are multiple networks that we can add add to our hard heads, 
以及如何在 Hardhat 中添加多个网络

9832
09:50:10,450 --> 09:50:13,900
we can make our project our EVM code, work with any network out there, 
这样我们就可以使我们项目的 EVM 代码用于任何网络上

9833
09:50:13,900 --> 09:50:16,870
we started working with dev dependencies instead of regular dependencies. 
我们开始使用 "devDependencies" 而不是常规依赖项

9834
09:50:16,870 --> 09:50:19,810
Now, READMEs are something that I'm not really going to go over too deeply in here. 
README 并不是一个我现在要深入讲解的东西

9835
09:50:19,840 --> 09:50:23,500
But READMEs are sort of like the welcome page of your GitHub repository, 
README 有点像是一个 GitHub 仓库的欢迎页面

9836
09:50:23,500 --> 09:50:26,170
and really should give you an understanding of what your code does. 
要能帮助他人了解你的代码是干什么的

9837
09:50:26,410 --> 09:50:29,440
Being a part of the web through space. And being a part of the blockchain ecosystem 
要想成为 Web3 和区块链领域的一部分

9838
09:50:29,530 --> 09:50:33,130
is really more than just you coding your stuff by yourself. 
仅仅是自己会写代码是完全不够的

9839
09:50:33,130 --> 09:50:36,490
You want other people to interact and engage with your code and engage with your projects. 
你得与其他人进行交互并促使他们参与你的代码和项目

9840
09:50:36,490 --> 09:50:39,970
I haven't showed you how to use GitHub yet. 
我还没有向你们展示如何使用 GitHub

9841
09:50:39,970 --> 09:50:42,280
But don't worry, we're going to 
但不用担心，很快就会讲到

9842
09:50:42,280 --> 09:50:45,580
but if you look at my heart had simple storage readme. 
如果你查看我的 "hardhat-simple-storage" 的 README

9843
09:50:45,610 --> 09:50:48,400
If you scroll down, 
如果你往下拉

9844
09:50:48,400 --> 09:50:50,860
usually, you really want to have a Getting Started section 
通常你会希望有一个“开始使用” ("Getting Started") 部分

9845
09:50:50,860 --> 09:50:53,350
where you define how to set up all the code and how to set everything up 
里面包含了如何配置全部代码以及如何进行设置

9846
09:50:53,350 --> 09:50:56,710
a Quickstart section, 
还有一个“快速上手” ("Quickstart") 部分

9847
09:50:56,710 --> 09:50:59,620
and maybe a usage section and some testing section, 
也许还会有一个“使用” ("Useage") 部分和一个“测试” ("Testing") 部分

9848
09:50:59,620 --> 09:51:02,920
which teaches people how to actually use and interact with your code. 
这些部分能教会人们如何实际使用你的代码并与之交互

9849
09:51:02,920 --> 09:51:06,730
Since we're just learning more of the code part
因为我们现在更多地还是在进行代码的学习

9850
09:51:06,730 --> 09:51:09,640
and not so much the readme part. 
而不是 README 环节

9851
09:51:09,640 --> 09:51:12,430
For now, we're not going to go over how to make a fantastic readme. 
所以目前我不会深入讲解如何把 README 做的出彩

9852
09:51:12,430 --> 09:51:15,040
However, I will leave a link in the GitHub repository associated with this course, 
不过，我会在课程关联的 GitHub 仓库里留下一个链接

9853
09:51:15,040 --> 09:51:18,190
link to this best readme template. 
它会链接到这个最佳的 README 模板下

9854
09:51:18,190 --> 09:51:20,680
It really is a fantastic readme template 
它真的是一个很不错的 README 模板

9855
09:51:20,800 --> 09:51:23,680
that you can copy to any of your projects to make them look really good and give them a really good setup, 
你可以把它复制到你的项目中并进行适当的配置，以使你的 README 也变得很好看

9856
09:51:23,680 --> 09:51:26,620
so that other developers can come to your project, 
这样其它开发者就可以参与到你的项目中

9857
09:51:26,620 --> 09:51:29,290
and learn and participate with what you're coding. 
并了解和参与你的编程工作

9858
09:51:29,290 --> 09:51:32,050
But all right, you have learned an absolute ton, 
但话说回来，你已经学了很多东西了

9859
09:51:32,050 --> 09:51:35,230
you should be incredibly proud of yourself, 
你应该为自己感到无比自豪

9860
09:51:35,230 --> 09:51:38,590
and incredibly excited that you've made it this far. 
并为自己能走到这一步而感到兴奋

9861
09:51:38,590 --> 09:51:41,530
Now I'm going to jump into the TypeScript section here. 
现在我要进入到 TypeScript 部分了

9862
09:51:41,530 --> 09:51:44,110
So for those of you who are coding along with TypeScript, 
对于那些要使用 TypeScript 的人来说

9863
09:51:44,110 --> 09:51:46,540
feel free to follow along. 
你可以选择跟进

9864
09:51:46,540 --> 09:51:49,300
For those of you who are not, 
如果你不是的话

9865
09:51:49,300 --> 09:51:52,120
you just finished the Basic section on hard hit, but stick around 
你刚刚只是完成了 Hardhat 的基础部分，所以请保持势头

9866
09:51:52,120 --> 09:51:55,270
the next to heart out sections are going to be the ones that really fine grain and hone your skills, 
接下来的两个 Hardhat 章节才是真正精细化以及磨练你技术的部分

9867
09:51:55,270 --> 09:51:58,540
and give you all the fundamentals for working with these frameworks. 
它们会为你提供使用这个框架所需的所有基本知识

9868
09:51:58,750 --> 09:52:01,240
So be sure to follow along with the next two sections, 
所以请务必跟上接下来的两个章节

9869
09:52:01,240 --> 09:52:04,090
we've got a ton more fantastic content for you, 
里面还有更精彩的内容等着你

9870
09:52:04,090 --> 09:52:07,780
we are just beginning to get deeper into the smart contract ecosystem. 
我们才刚刚开始深入智能合约的生态系统

9871
09:52:07,780 --> 09:52:10,660
So take that lap, get that coffee, and I'll see you soon. 
所以休息一下，喝杯咖啡，待会儿再见
