12251
12:25:12,770 --> 12:25:19,070
What do we want to do with it? 
我们要用它来做些什么？

12252
12:25:19,070 --> 12:25:21,770
Well, we've been playing around with GitHub so much, 
我们一直在大量使用 GitHub

12253
12:25:21,770 --> 12:25:24,800
we've been looking at all these good hubs. 
一直在看这些 GitHub

12254
12:25:24,800 --> 12:25:29,720
It's time for us to join GitHub with our own with our first repository. 
现在是时候让我们亲自加入 GitHub 创造属于我们自己的第一个仓库了

12255
12:25:29,720 --> 12:25:33,320
Let's go ahead and let's make this happen 
让我们来实现这个目标

12256
12:25:33,320 --> 12:25:36,110
in the lesson seven full blockchain solidity course, yes, 
在 "full-blockchain-solidity-course-js" 的 "Lesson 7" 中

12257
12:25:36,110 --> 12:25:39,080
there is a link to this GitHub Quickstart 
有一个到 "Github Quickstart" 的链接

12258
12:25:39,080 --> 12:25:42,440
that we're going to follow to set up our first repository. 
我们可以参照它来设置我们的首个仓库

12259
12:25:42,440 --> 12:25:45,290
This is going to be the moment where you are starting to build your portfolio 
现在是时候开始创建你的档案了

12260
12:25:45,290 --> 12:25:48,200
building and GitHub is borderline crucial for your development journey. 
建立一个 GitHub 对你的开发之旅来说至关重要

12261
12:25:48,200 --> 12:25:50,420
It's going to be your portal folio, it's going to be where you say, 
它会成为你的档案，你可以在这里告诉其他人

12262
12:25:50,690 --> 12:25:53,150
Hey, look at all the cool products that I'm engaging with, that I'm working with, that I'm participating in. 
嘿，看看我参与和从事的炫酷产品

12263
12:25:53,150 --> 12:25:55,910
If you've already made GitHub before, 
如果你之前就用过 GitHub 

12264
12:25:55,910 --> 12:25:58,670
I highly recommend you still push this up to GitHub 
我强烈建议你仍然要把这些成果推送到 GitHub 上

12265
12:25:58,670 --> 12:26:01,700
as proof that you've done it. 
它可以证明你做到了

12266
12:26:01,700 --> 12:26:04,760
And then you can also tweet it at me saying, hey, look how far I've gotten. 
你还可以到 Twitter 上说一下，嘿，看看我走了多远！

12267
12:26:04,760 --> 12:26:07,790
Look where I've done, look at how fantastic I'm learning smart contracts, 
看看我智能合约学的多好！

12268
12:26:07,790 --> 12:26:10,160
and be incredibly excited about now, 
然后好好兴奋一下吧

12269
12:26:10,160 --> 12:26:13,130
this quickstart will walk you through creating a repository, creating a branch and teaching all this stuff, 
这个 Quickstart 会引导你创建仓库，创建分支，并教给你所有这些东西

12270
12:26:13,130 --> 12:26:16,100
we're going to follow the instructions from the GitHub documentation 
我们将按照 GitHub 的这个文档说明进行操作

12271
12:26:16,100 --> 12:26:18,680
about adding locally hosted code to GitHub, 
即“添加本地托管代码到 GitHub”
("Adding locally hosted code to GitHub")

12272
12:26:18,680 --> 12:26:21,770
we already have a project, and we're just pushing it up. 
我们已经有了一个项目，现在只用把它推送上来就行了

12273
12:26:21,770 --> 12:26:25,430
Since the Windows users are using WsL,
由于 Windows 用户用的是 WSL

12274
12:26:25,520 --> 12:26:28,370
you can just follow the Mac or Linux instructions here, 
所以你可以直接参照 Mac 和 Linux 的说明进行操作

12275
12:26:28,370 --> 12:26:31,550
the first thing that we're going to do is in your GitHub profile, 
我们要做的第一件事是来到你的 GitHub 的 "profile" 页面

12276
12:26:31,550 --> 12:26:34,760
or your GitHub login, 
或是你的 GitHub 登录页面

12277
12:26:34,760 --> 12:26:37,880
we're gonna hit this little plus thing, and hit new repository, 
我们要点击这里的小加号并点击 "New repository"

12278
12:26:37,880 --> 12:26:43,940
you can call this whatever you want, let's call it hard hat, fund me b code camp, 
你可以随意命名，我命名为 "hardhat-fund-me-fcc"

12279
12:26:43,940 --> 12:26:49,910
you can put a description if you want, 
如有需要你还可以添加描述("Description")

12280
12:26:49,910 --> 12:26:51,320
learning from recode camp, and Patrick, about smart contracts.
跟着 FCC & Patrick 一起学习智能合约！！！
("Learning from FCC & Patrick about Smart Contracts!!!")

12281
12:26:52,670 --> 12:26:55,070
We'll make it public because we want other people to see you being fantastic and learning smart contracts. 
我们设置为公开("Public")，因为我们希望其他人能看到你学习智能合约的杰出表现

12282
12:26:55,070 --> 12:26:57,740
We'll leave this blank, and we'll hit Create repository. 
这个部分我们留白，接着点击 "Create repository"

12283
12:26:57,740 --> 12:27:01,820
Now, this is our public code repository. 
现在，这就是我们的公开代码仓库了

12284
12:27:01,850 --> 12:27:04,970
This is our first one, 
这是我们的首个仓库

12285
12:27:04,970 --> 12:27:08,000
if you've done these already, this will be your first smart contract one. 
如果你以前有过的话，那这个就是你的首个智能合约仓库

12286
12:27:08,030 --> 12:27:11,810
It even has some instructions in here, too, that teaches us how to create a new repository from the command line, 
这里甚至还有一些说明，它在教我们如何在命令行中创建一个新的仓库

12287
12:27:11,810 --> 12:27:14,900
you can follow this if you want, or you can follow like so 
你可以跟着这个来做，也可以跟着我来做

12288
12:27:14,900 --> 12:27:18,470
the first thing we're going to do is we're going to initialize a git branch. 
我们要做的第一件事是初始化一个 git 分支

12289
12:27:18,470 --> 12:27:23,000
And from way back when you should already have Git installed. 
很久之前，你应该就已经安装好 git 了

12290
12:27:23,120 --> 12:27:26,300
Remember, you can check by running git dash dash version like this. 
你可以像这样，运行 `git --version` 来进行检查

12291
12:27:26,390 --> 12:27:29,150
Git is a little different from GitHub, 
git 和 GitHub 还是有一点不同的

12292
12:27:29,150 --> 12:27:32,270
Git is known as version control. 
git 就是所谓的版本控制系统("Version Control")

12293
12:27:32,270 --> 12:27:35,780
And it allows us to make changes to our code, but keep a history of all the code changes that we've made. 
它可以让我们在更改代码后保留全部的代码更改历史

12294
12:27:35,780 --> 12:27:39,200
GitHub is a place where we can push all of these changes and keep track of all of our code. 
而 GitHub 则是我们推送更改和跟踪代码的地方

12295
12:27:39,200 --> 12:27:43,040
So the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to create a new branch. 
所以我们的第一件事就是创建一个新的分支

12296
12:27:43,040 --> 12:27:45,560
And I'm not going to explain Git and working with Git too, too deeply. 
我不打算过于深入地介绍和使用 git 

12297
12:27:45,560 --> 12:27:48,290
But if you want to learn about Git 
但如果你想学习有关 git 的知识的话

12298
12:27:48,290 --> 12:27:51,500
Free Code Camp, of course, has a video on Git and GitHub for beginners. 
"freeCodeCamp" 有一个关于 git 和 GitHub 的面向初学者的视频

12299
12:27:51,500 --> 12:27:54,620
So we're going to create this new branch with git init dash b main, 
我们来创建一下这个新分支 `git init -b main`

12300
12:27:54,620 --> 12:27:58,130
now your Visual Studio code might automatically start formatting some stuff. 
你的 Visual Studio Code 可能会自动开始做一些格式化

12301
12:27:58,130 --> 12:28:02,000



12302
12:28:02,000 --> 12:28:05,090



12303
12:28:05,090 --> 12:28:07,910
And if it does, that's great. And if it doesn't,


12304
12:28:07,970 --> 12:28:10,670
don't worry about it. But what you'll see here on the left is


12305
12:28:10,670 --> 12:28:14,930
you'll see some stuff is green, and some stuff is gray, open


12306
12:28:14,930 --> 12:28:17,960
back up that dot Git ignore, you'll see that all the gray


12307
12:28:17,960 --> 12:28:21,050
stuff is the stuff that we have in this dot Git ignore this is


12308
12:28:21,050 --> 12:28:23,840
intentional, this is what we want. This is just some some


12309
12:28:23,840 --> 12:28:26,270
highlighting saying, hey, this green stuff is what you're


12310
12:28:26,270 --> 12:28:29,360
working with on GitHub. And this gray stuff is what you're not


12311
12:28:29,360 --> 12:28:31,970
working with and GitHub. And that's what we want. You don't


12312
12:28:31,970 --> 12:28:35,420
need to push artifacts, or cash or coverage or node modules,


12313
12:28:35,420 --> 12:28:39,530
people can install and compile on their own machines, we


12314
12:28:39,560 --> 12:28:43,070
definitely don't want to push up our Dotty and V if we're using a


12315
12:28:43,070 --> 12:28:46,070
Dotty and V. And we don't really need to push up coverage dot


12316
12:28:46,070 --> 12:28:50,420
JSON, either the rest of this we do. So now what's next, after we


12317
12:28:50,450 --> 12:28:54,380
initialize our main branch, you now should be able to run git


12318
12:28:54,380 --> 12:28:59,450
status in your terminal and see this huge red output of all


12319
12:28:59,450 --> 12:29:03,140
these things that are untracked, and we don't have any commits


12320
12:29:03,140 --> 12:29:07,370
for, what we can do now is we can stage all of our code with


12321
12:29:07,370 --> 12:29:11,570
git add period, and then commit it with Git commit, we're going


12322
12:29:11,570 --> 12:29:14,420
to run these one at a time instead of together. Before I


12323
12:29:14,420 --> 12:29:17,570
run git add, I'm going to add deployments to this list too,


12324
12:29:17,570 --> 12:29:19,760
because GitHub doesn't really need to know about all the


12325
12:29:19,760 --> 12:29:22,340
different deployments I make, especially when I make a ton of


12326
12:29:22,340 --> 12:29:24,800
deployments to my local hosts, they don't need to know. So


12327
12:29:24,800 --> 12:29:28,880
we're going to add that to, then we're going to run git add dot.


12328
12:29:29,090 --> 12:29:34,400
And if we do a git status, now, we can see all of our code has


12329
12:29:34,400 --> 12:29:38,420
been staged for being committed for being a part of this history


12330
12:29:38,720 --> 12:29:41,810
of our code. And then take a quick look at all these files


12331
12:29:41,810 --> 12:29:46,220
and make sure your dot E and V file is not and never in here.


12332
12:29:46,340 --> 12:29:49,370
So now we're going to run git commit dash m and then this


12333
12:29:49,370 --> 12:29:55,580
message for our commit, okay, so we'll run git commit dash m, we


12334
12:29:55,580 --> 12:29:59,180
can say, initial commit, or whatever you want in this


12335
12:29:59,180 --> 12:30:02,000
message here, first commit, initial commit, who cares, and


12336
12:30:02,000 --> 12:30:04,490
it's gonna say, create mode, blah, blah, blah, for all of


12337
12:30:04,490 --> 12:30:08,120
these files. And if we do git status, now, it's blank on


12338
12:30:08,120 --> 12:30:11,120
branch main, nothing to commit. And then you might get something


12339
12:30:11,120 --> 12:30:13,730
like this. If you've never worked with Git before your name


12340
12:30:13,730 --> 12:30:16,490
and email were added automatically. We're a little


12341
12:30:16,490 --> 12:30:20,060
bit confused here. We'll talk about this in just a second. So


12342
12:30:20,060 --> 12:30:23,630
next, what we can do is we're actually going to copy the URL


12343
12:30:23,660 --> 12:30:27,110
of our GitHub repo. So you can grab that just by copying here


12344
12:30:27,140 --> 12:30:30,620
or right at the top, that URL right there. And what we're


12345
12:30:30,620 --> 12:30:33,710
going to do is we're going to add this as a remote repo. To do


12346
12:30:33,710 --> 12:30:39,380
that. We'll do git remote add, and we'll give this remote repo


12347
12:30:39,410 --> 12:30:44,330
a name. For us. We'll say origin and then we'll paste that URL


12348
12:30:44,330 --> 12:30:48,770
there. We're now saying the the origin remote repo is good.


12349
12:30:48,770 --> 12:30:54,020
Gonna be at this URL, we run git remote dash v, we can see that


12350
12:30:54,230 --> 12:30:58,850
the origin repo for fetching is at this branch. And the origin


12351
12:30:58,850 --> 12:31:02,600
repo for pushing is also at this branch. So when we want to get


12352
12:31:02,600 --> 12:31:06,650
new code, a fetch code will fetch it from here. And if we


12353
12:31:06,650 --> 12:31:09,950
want to push code up, we want to give code to the GitHub. We'll


12354
12:31:09,980 --> 12:31:13,490
also get it from here. So now we've set the new remote with


12355
12:31:13,490 --> 12:31:17,990
that remote URL. Now we're going to actually push the changes to


12356
12:31:17,990 --> 12:31:22,730
github.com. And the way we do that is with Git push, and we


12357
12:31:22,730 --> 12:31:25,250
pick which remote we want to push to, and we're going to push


12358
12:31:25,250 --> 12:31:29,060
the origin. And then which branch we want to push to which


12359
12:31:29,060 --> 12:31:32,090
we're going to push to Maine, it'll probably prompt you for


12360
12:31:32,090 --> 12:31:34,520
your username and your password, and maybe your email and


12361
12:31:34,520 --> 12:31:36,530
everything. Now, if authentication doesn't work for


12362
12:31:36,530 --> 12:31:39,410
you, for some reason, you can come over to Settings. Or if you


12363
12:31:39,410 --> 12:31:44,090
scroll down to developer settings, Personal Access Tokens


12364
12:31:44,090 --> 12:31:46,760
and create generate new token, some token,


12365
12:31:48,020 --> 12:31:51,980
give yourself repo access, write access, and hit Generate token.


12366
12:31:52,610 --> 12:31:55,580
And try to use this token as your password. Instead, be sure


12367
12:31:55,580 --> 12:31:58,970
to use the GitHub documentation and the GitHub discussion


12368
12:31:59,000 --> 12:32:01,760
associated with this course, if you get lost or if something


12369
12:32:01,760 --> 12:32:05,540
doesn't work, as shown here. But once it's done, once you add all


12370
12:32:05,540 --> 12:32:08,270
that information in correctly, you come back to your get up and


12371
12:32:08,270 --> 12:32:11,930
you will have your first GitHub repo with all the code and


12372
12:32:11,930 --> 12:32:15,650
everything in it like this. And once you complete this step,


12373
12:32:15,650 --> 12:32:18,770
once you do this, you should absolutely celebrate. If you


12374
12:32:18,770 --> 12:32:21,770
like, you can shoot a tweet web three community in the


12375
12:32:21,770 --> 12:32:24,260
blockchain community is absolutely this collaborative


12376
12:32:24,260 --> 12:32:26,660
space. So Twitter crypto is where a lot of these people


12377
12:32:26,660 --> 12:32:30,500
congregate to share ideas. So definitely be sure to celebrate


12378
12:32:30,500 --> 12:32:33,200
and share this and be really, really excited. And shoot a


12379
12:32:33,200 --> 12:32:35,990
tweet out like this. Give your friends a high five, share it on


12380
12:32:35,990 --> 12:32:38,810
Twitter, share it on Discord shared on Reddit, be excited for


12381
12:32:38,810 --> 12:32:41,510
how far you've gotten, we've got a lot more to go. But by


12382
12:32:41,510 --> 12:32:44,690
completing this part, you have done fantastically, and I'm so


12383
12:32:44,690 --> 12:32:47,660
excited for you to start the next section. Now, we're not


12384
12:32:47,660 --> 12:32:50,150
going to go over the TypeScript addition to this because there's


12385
12:32:50,150 --> 12:32:53,210
nothing really new here. However, again, if you want to


12386
12:32:53,210 --> 12:32:56,060
see TypeScript, feel free to jump into the GitHub repository


12387
12:32:56,090 --> 12:32:57,380
associated with this course.
