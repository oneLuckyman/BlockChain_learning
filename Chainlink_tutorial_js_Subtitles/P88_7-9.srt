10884
10:55:42,410 --> 10:55:48,560
Now let's go ahead and deploy this to With the Rinkeby test net, 
现在让我们把它部署到 Rinkeby 测试网上

10885
10:55:48,590 --> 10:55:51,470
and what do we need to deploy this to the Rinkeby test net? 
那么部署到 Rinkeby 测试网上需要做哪些事呢？

10886
10:55:51,470 --> 10:55:53,900
Well, let's jump into our hard hat config first. 
让我们先转到 "hardhat.config"

10887
10:55:53,900 --> 10:55:57,140
And let's clean this up, we don't really need this accounts task, 
并且清除掉这些内容，我们并不需要这个 "accounts" task

10888
10:55:57,140 --> 10:56:00,410
so I'm just going to delete it, 
所以我们要把它删掉

10889
10:56:00,410 --> 10:56:03,710
I don't really need this comment. So I'm going to delete this too. 
我也不需要这个注释了，所以也要删掉

10890
10:56:03,710 --> 10:56:06,470
And let's jump into the network section, 
现在让我们进入 "network" 部分

10891
10:56:06,470 --> 10:56:09,560
we're not going to be working with ropsten. So we're gonna go ahead and dump that. 
我们不会使用 "ropsten"，所以我们扔掉它

10892
10:56:09,560 --> 10:56:13,370
We are however, going to be working with rink B, the URL is going to be that same Rinkeby RPC URL. 
但我们要使用 "Rinkeby"，"url" 还是一样的 `RINKEBY_RPC_URL`

10893
10:56:13,370 --> 10:56:18,410
So we're going to define that up here, like we did before. 
我们在这里定义它，就和之前的做法一样

10894
10:56:18,410 --> 10:56:21,950
And if you want to copy paste from your last project, feel free to do so 
你可以选择从上一个项目中直接复制粘贴过来

10895
10:56:21,950 --> 10:56:25,280
you can also follow along with me or fastforward me 
也可以选择跟着我或者快进

10896
10:56:25,280 --> 10:56:38,540
the counts is going to be the same. 
`accounts` 是相同的

10897
10:56:38,540 --> 10:56:41,360
I'm going to go ahead and just copy paste the gas reporter with what we had from before. 
我这里直接复制粘贴了之前使用过的 `gasReporter`

10898
10:56:41,360 --> 10:56:44,960
So we're going to add this 
所以我们要添加一句 

10899
10:56:44,960 --> 10:56:49,340
constant corn market cap API key equals process dot EMV dot corn market cap API key. 
`const COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY = process.env.COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY`

10900
10:56:49,340 --> 10:56:53,600
Do the same thing with the ether scan API key Licious add everything in here. Now. 
`ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` 也是一样的，添加到这里来

10901
10:56:53,600 --> 10:57:00,920
We have our ether scan section in here already, 


10902
10:57:00,920 --> 10:57:04,160
we're gonna have our gas reporter be


10903
10:57:04,160 --> 10:57:06,800
false, because I don't really feel like using it right now.


10904
10:57:07,070 --> 10:57:09,920
And then finally, we're going to add one more thing in here.


10905
10:57:10,130 --> 10:57:12,830
Remember how in our last project, before we actually


10906
10:57:12,830 --> 10:57:16,100
verified we waited some block confirmations. That way ether


10907
10:57:16,100 --> 10:57:19,130
scan could make sure to catch up. Well, we can do the exact


10908
10:57:19,130 --> 10:57:22,910
same thing in here in our hard hat dot config, we can add a


10909
10:57:22,910 --> 10:57:26,300
section for each test net for how many blocks we want to wait,


10910
10:57:26,570 --> 10:57:33,320
I'm going to add block confirmations of six. Now back


10911
10:57:33,320 --> 10:57:36,920
on our deploy Funmi. In a new section, I can add wait


10912
10:57:37,130 --> 10:57:46,340
confirmations of network dot config. That block on for


10913
10:57:47,180 --> 10:57:53,480
motions, or one is or one means if no block confirmations is


10914
10:57:53,480 --> 10:57:57,110
given in our Hardhead dot config will just wait for one block.


10915
10:57:57,290 --> 10:57:59,960
And again, the reason we want to wait for approximately six block


10916
10:57:59,960 --> 10:58:03,410
confirmations is we want to give ether scan a chance to index our


10917
10:58:03,410 --> 10:58:07,490
transaction. And I added a chain ID 42 when it should be for my


10918
10:58:07,490 --> 10:58:11,240
mistake. And of course, we're going to need our dot env file,


10919
10:58:11,420 --> 10:58:14,660
where we add all of our stuff from the last session, the RIP


10920
10:58:14,660 --> 10:58:18,650
ERP CRL private key ether scan API and then coin market cap


10921
10:58:18,650 --> 10:58:23,000
API. All right moment of truth. Let's try this out. If we run


10922
10:58:23,000 --> 10:58:30,020
yarn Hardhead deploy dash dash network Rinkeby. It should not


10923
10:58:30,050 --> 10:58:34,040
deploy any marks because we have this if statement in our mock


10924
10:58:34,040 --> 10:58:39,050
deployment. But it should deploy our Funmi contract using the


10925
10:58:39,050 --> 10:58:43,250
correct price feed address. And then it'll go ahead and verify


10926
10:58:43,250 --> 10:58:47,300
it. Since we're waiting for six block confirmations, we can even


10927
10:58:47,300 --> 10:58:51,500
be super secure by adding dash dash tags and just running the


10928
10:58:51,500 --> 10:58:55,790
funding tag. But we're just going to do yarn hearted deploy


10929
10:58:55,820 --> 10:58:59,930
network Rigby. And let's see what happens. All right, and


10930
10:58:59,930 --> 10:59:03,950
we're deploying funding. And we can see the transaction that we


10931
10:59:03,950 --> 10:59:08,630
have for fun me, this is that logging feature, we have log is


10932
10:59:08,630 --> 10:59:12,860
true for deploying Funmi. So it gives us the transaction once it


10933
10:59:12,860 --> 10:59:16,160
has a transaction, and it will give us the address once we have


10934
10:59:16,160 --> 10:59:20,120
the address. So we're going to wait six block confirmations for


10935
10:59:20,120 --> 10:59:23,240
this transaction to finish going through. Now we see we've


10936
10:59:23,240 --> 10:59:27,230
deployed this contract address with X amount of gas. And now


10937
10:59:27,260 --> 10:59:30,410
we're running the verification process. While the verification


10938
10:59:30,410 --> 10:59:35,630
process is running, we can pull up Rinkeby ether scan, paste our


10939
10:59:35,630 --> 10:59:39,560
address in here and see that we have indeed created this


10940
10:59:39,560 --> 10:59:42,620
contract. And now it looks like we've successfully verified the


10941
10:59:42,620 --> 10:59:46,760
contract on ether scan. So if we hit refresh, we can indeed see


10942
10:59:46,790 --> 10:59:50,030
that the contract has been verified. Awesome. All right. So


10943
10:59:50,030 --> 10:59:53,570
this is fantastic. Our deploy script is looking great, we're


10944
10:59:53,570 --> 10:59:57,110
able to deploy to a local chain, we're able to deploy to a test


10945
10:59:57,110 --> 11:00:00,050
that and if we wanted to, we could deploy to any network that


10946
11:00:00,050 --> 11:00:03,860
we wanted simply by updating our hard hat config, and then


10947
11:00:03,890 --> 11:00:07,700
updating our helper config. This is fantastic.


10948
11:00:07,730 --> 11:00:13,610
Great work so far.
