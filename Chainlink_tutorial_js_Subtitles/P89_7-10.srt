10948
11:00:07,730 --> 11:00:13,610
Now we're about to jump in and level up our tests. 
现在我们要开始升级我们的测试了

10949
11:00:13,610 --> 11:00:16,430
But before we do that, 
但在此之前

10950
11:00:16,460 --> 11:00:19,130
we're going to clean up our Funmi contract a little bit to make it look a little bit more professional. 
我们将稍微整理一下 "FundMe" 合约以让它看起来更加专业

10951
11:00:19,130 --> 11:00:22,190
And I'm going to talk about some of the syntax and some of the reasons why some conventions exist. 
我会讲解一些语法以及一些惯例之所以存在的原因

10952
11:00:22,190 --> 11:00:25,520
We're not going to do this full force on all the projects moving forward. 
我们不会在之后的项目中往这方面投入很大的力气

10953
11:00:25,520 --> 11:00:28,970
But they are good to know and they are good to keep in mind
但了解并记住它们是很有益的

10954
11:00:29,210 --> 11:00:31,820
when moving forward and working with our contracts. 
尤其是在处理我们的合约的时候

10955
11:00:31,910 --> 11:00:35,330
While we go through this we're going to learn why some of these conventions exist 
在这个过程中，我们将了解这些惯例为什么会存在

10956
11:00:35,330 --> 11:00:37,640
including learning a little bit of low level solidity. 
而且会学习一些 Solidity 更底层的知识

10957
11:00:37,640 --> 11:00:40,460
So don't skip this part. 
因此，请不要跳过这部分

10958
11:00:40,460 --> 11:00:43,400
When we get to later sections. 
当我们抵达更靠后的章节时

10959
11:00:43,400 --> 11:00:46,460
We're going to be a little bit looser and not be as strict with the code style guides 
我们会变得稍微宽松一些，不会像代码风格指南那样严格

10960
11:00:46,460 --> 11:00:49,700
but That's basically what we're gonna go over now. 
但基本上，这就是我们现在要讨论的内容

10961
11:00:49,700 --> 11:00:52,400
And for now, you might see this event funded thing here, 
现在，你可能会看到这里有个 `event Funded`

10962
11:00:52,400 --> 11:00:55,250
please just ignore that for now, 
请暂时先忽略它

10963
11:00:55,250 --> 11:00:58,730
in an earlier take, I'd introduced the events much earlier. 
在较早版本的课程中，我比较早地介绍了 "event"

10964
11:00:58,730 --> 11:01:00,530
And now we're actually going to learn about events a little bit later in the course. 
但现在我们会在更靠后的课程中学习 "event"

10965
11:01:00,530 --> 11:01:04,070
So please ignore that event funded for now. 
所以请暂时忽略掉 `event Funded`

10966
11:01:04,070 --> 11:01:06,380
So let's go ahead and tweak a little bit of our contracts here. 
让我们继续，来稍微修改一下我们的合约

10967
11:01:06,380 --> 11:01:08,900
Now what I'm talking about tweaking this to make it look professional, a little bit more professional, 
我所说的优化我们的合约以让它看起来更专业的意思

10968
11:01:08,900 --> 11:01:11,240
I'm talking about the solidity style guide, 
指的就是 Solidity 的风格指南("Style Guide")

10969
11:01:11,240 --> 11:01:14,690
there are some conventions for naming and ordering 
有一些关于命名和排序的惯例

10970
11:01:14,690 --> 11:01:17,810
that we can follow to make our code look a little bit better. 
可以通过遵循它们以使我们的代码看起来更好

10971
11:01:17,810 --> 11:01:20,390
Now, like I said, this is going to be a little bit more optional, 
就像我说的，这是一个可选步骤

10972
11:01:20,390 --> 11:01:23,360
because it can be a little bit verbose. 
因为它可能会有些冗长

10973
11:01:23,510 --> 11:01:26,330
And it doesn't really make that big of a difference. 


10974
11:01:26,330 --> 11:01:29,870
But it can increase readability of your contracts by a lot and make your code look a lot nicer. 


10975
11:01:29,870 --> 11:01:33,350
So if you want, you can go through this style guide to learn more about 


10976
11:01:33,380 --> 11:01:36,800
what kind of makes solidity look nice, and what makes it not look nice. 


10977
11:01:36,800 --> 11:01:39,290
But well, that's some of these style guides in here, 


10978
11:01:39,290 --> 11:01:41,360
we're not going to follow the style guide exactly to a tee. 


10979
11:01:41,360 --> 11:01:44,090
But we are going to make some best efforts to make our code follow the style guide, 


10980
11:01:44,090 --> 11:01:47,060
we've got a link to the style guide in the GitHub repository for this section, 


10981
11:01:47,060 --> 11:01:50,150
we can read some more about the layout. 


10982
11:01:50,150 --> 11:01:53,210
But the main thing we want to look at is this order of the layout, 


10983
11:01:53,210 --> 11:01:55,700
we want to start with our imports 


10984
11:01:55,700 --> 11:01:59,180
with our pragma statement, our imports, interfaces, libraries, and then contracts. 


10985
11:01:59,210 --> 11:02:02,450
And then inside each contract type declarations, state variables, events, modifiers, and functions. 


10986
11:02:02,450 --> 11:02:05,480
So let's go back here and make sure that we're up to speed, 


10987
11:02:05,510 --> 11:02:08,990
we want our pragma first. 


10988
11:02:08,990 --> 11:02:12,530
Alright, awesome, we did exactly that, 


10989
11:02:12,530 --> 11:02:16,610
then we want our imports. Okay, awesome, we have those too. 


10990
11:02:16,640 --> 11:02:19,460
Something that's not in the style guide is going to be error codes, 


10991
11:02:19,460 --> 11:02:22,820
which we definitely want next. 


10992
11:02:22,820 --> 11:02:27,140
So next is going to be error codes. 


10993
11:02:27,140 --> 11:02:30,410
Now this is where we're going to bump into one of our first updates here. 


10994
11:02:30,410 --> 11:02:34,400
As of recent, it's sort of becoming a best practice to 


10995
11:02:34,400 --> 11:02:37,820
add the name of your contract, some underscores, and then the name of your error.


10996
11:02:38,000 --> 11:02:40,580
Whenever you're running into an error. 


10997
11:02:40,610 --> 11:02:43,970
This makes it a lot easier to understand which contract is throwing the error.


10998
11:02:44,030 --> 11:02:48,350
So for this, we're going to say error Funmi, two underscores not owner, 


10999
11:02:48,350 --> 11:02:52,190
then we're going to scroll down to the our revert and set it like this. 


11000
11:02:52,490 --> 11:02:56,120
This way, when if we ever run into this error, 


11001
11:02:56,120 --> 11:02:59,240
we know that the error is coming from the Funmi contract,


11002
11:02:59,480 --> 11:03:01,940
not from the aggregator v3 interface, 


11003
11:03:01,940 --> 11:03:05,090
or the price converter or some other contract. 


11004
11:03:05,090 --> 11:03:07,820
So that's how we want to write our error codes here. 


11005
11:03:07,820 --> 11:03:11,720
If we had any interfaces or libraries not imported, we would add them here. 


11006
11:03:11,750 --> 11:03:15,050
But then finally, we add our contracts. 


11007
11:03:15,050 --> 11:03:18,950
In this file, we only have one contract here. 


11008
11:03:18,950 --> 11:03:21,590
It's our Funmi contract. Awesome. 


11009
11:03:21,590 --> 11:03:26,810
Now the next thing we want to learn about as far as style guides go is this thing scalled natspec. 


11010
11:03:26,810 --> 11:03:30,500
natspec stands for Etherium natural language specification format. 


11011
11:03:30,530 --> 11:03:34,490
And it's basically a way of documenting our code inspired by Doxygen 


11012
11:03:34,490 --> 11:03:38,270
uses Doxygen style comments and tags to help document our code, 


11013
11:03:38,270 --> 11:03:41,270
you can click the link here in the solidity documentation to learn more about Doxygen. 


11014
11:03:41,270 --> 11:03:43,880
If we scroll down in the documentation, here, 


11015
11:03:43,880 --> 11:03:47,330
we can see an example of using natspec. 


11016
11:03:47,330 --> 11:03:50,450
Whenever we have a contract or a function that needs documentation, 


11017
11:03:50,450 --> 11:03:53,750
we can add some syntax that looks like this to it. 


11018
11:03:53,750 --> 11:03:57,470
So for example, if we wanted to add this to our code, 


11019
11:03:57,500 --> 11:04:00,560
we could add a comment explaining this funding contract 


11020
11:04:00,590 --> 11:04:05,210
to start a piece of natspec, you can do three backslashes, 


11021
11:04:05,870 --> 11:04:09,350
or one backslash, two stars, and then another ending star here. x


11022
11:04:09,350 --> 11:04:12,200
or one backslash, two stars, and then comment section basically gets turned into a comment. 


11023
11:04:12,200 --> 11:04:15,590
For the start of our contract, we'll do the Add sign title 


11024
11:04:15,590 --> 11:04:18,050
to explain basically, what this contract is, 


11025
11:04:18,050 --> 11:04:20,270
it's fun, we contract is going to be a contract for crowdfunding, 


11026
11:04:20,390 --> 11:04:27,980
we'll add another star. And we can add the author of it, 


11027
11:04:27,980 --> 11:04:31,610
which is going to be your name, I'm going to put Patrick Collins, of course, 


11028
11:04:31,640 --> 11:04:35,030
then we'll add a notice, which is just kind of a note to people 


11029
11:04:35,030 --> 11:04:39,800
we can say this contract is is to demo a sample funding contract. 


11030
11:04:39,800 --> 11:04:46,250
And we can also add apt Dev,


11031
11:04:46,670 --> 11:04:49,820
which is a note specifically to developers. 


11032
11:04:50,120 --> 11:04:54,770
And we can say this implements price feeds as our library. 


11033
11:04:54,770 --> 11:04:58,850
The reason that we want to add these tags here 


11034
11:04:58,850 --> 11:05:02,360
is actually because we can use the natspec to automatically create documentation for us 


11035
11:05:02,360 --> 11:05:06,350
if we download so we can actually run solc dash s user doc dash dash dev doc, 


11036
11:05:06,350 --> 11:05:10,220
and the name of our file to automatically generate documentation. 


11037
11:05:10,220 --> 11:05:13,820
So this is also really helpful for 


11038
11:05:13,820 --> 11:05:16,370
automatically creating documentation for other developers who interact with the protocol later on. 


11039
11:05:16,370 --> 11:05:20,300
You can use this natspec For as many or as few functions as you'd like. 


11040
11:05:20,300 --> 11:05:23,090
Most of us probably aren't going to be making documentation. 


11041
11:05:23,090 --> 11:05:26,120
So we really just want to follow those guidelines 


11042
11:05:26,120 --> 11:05:29,300
if we think some function or some section of our code 


11043
11:05:29,300 --> 11:05:32,240
is a little bit tricky for other developers. 


11044
11:05:32,240 --> 11:05:34,910
Now that we're inside of contract, we can follow the order of our contract. 


11045
11:05:34,910 --> 11:05:39,110
We're first going to start with type declarations


11046
11:05:41,870 --> 11:05:43,790
which we don't really have any except for the fact 


11047
11:05:43,790 --> 11:05:48,410
that we're using our price converter for the UN 256 type. 


11048
11:05:48,650 --> 11:05:51,140
Okay, great. You Next, after our type declarations, 


11049
11:05:51,170 --> 11:05:54,380
we're going to do state variables. 


11050
11:05:54,380 --> 11:05:57,410
And in this state variables section, 


11051
11:05:57,410 --> 11:06:00,170
this is where we're actually going to change the name of some of our state variables. 


11052
11:06:00,170 --> 11:06:04,370
So we'll do a little common here state variables. 


11053
11:06:04,400 --> 11:06:08,780
Now in the solidity style guide, kind of adhere to the naming styles, 


11054
11:06:08,810 --> 11:06:12,080
we use upper and lowercase, we use total caps with underscores here. 


11055
11:06:12,080 --> 11:06:14,750
However, these naming variables are going to change in the future in this section. 


11056
11:06:14,750 --> 11:06:16,820
And if you're following along with the GitHub repo associated with this course,


11057
11:06:17,180 --> 11:06:19,340
these are going to be actually a little bit different than what you see. 


11058
11:06:19,340 --> 11:06:22,400
However, for now, we're going to leave them as they are,


11059
11:06:22,400 --> 11:06:24,710
because the reason why we're going to change them isn't going to be quite clear yet. 


11060
11:06:24,710 --> 11:06:27,980
Don't worry. So these names are going to change soon, but not yet. 


11061
11:06:27,980 --> 11:06:31,310
Alright, after state variables comes events, and modifiers. 


11062
11:06:31,310 --> 11:06:34,940
We don't have any events, but we do have a modifier. 


11063
11:06:34,940 --> 11:06:39,560
So we'll copy this. And actually, we'll delete this comment here. 


11064
11:06:39,560 --> 11:06:46,850
And we'll paste our modifier here. 


11065
11:06:46,850 --> 11:06:50,120
Oh, and it looks like looks like we're not auto formatting here. 


11066
11:06:50,450 --> 11:06:52,820
So we're going to uncomment immutable actually, 


11067
11:06:52,880 --> 11:06:55,160
so that it automatically auto formats. 


11068
11:06:55,160 --> 11:06:57,440
Okay, great. We're out of formatting now. And Cool. 


11069
11:06:57,440 --> 11:07:01,100
Alright, so now we have our modifiers. Next, 


11070
11:07:01,100 --> 11:07:05,030
we have right here, and then we have all of our functions. Great. 


11071
11:07:05,030 --> 11:07:08,390
We actually want to group our functions in this order that I just print here. 


11072
11:07:08,390 --> 11:07:11,720
So we want the constructor which we have received and fall back, 


11073
11:07:11,720 --> 11:07:14,570
we do have fall back and receive. 


11074
11:07:14,570 --> 11:07:20,690
So we're going to actually copy those and delete this comment. 


11075
11:07:20,690 --> 11:07:24,110
We're gonna stick those veterans Heath here looks like receive goes first. 


11076
11:07:24,110 --> 11:07:28,460
So we'll put that here. Then external functions, then public, internal, private.


11077
11:07:29,180 --> 11:07:32,480
So we have public public. And that's it. And then we can delete this part down here. Okay. 


11078
11:07:32,480 --> 11:07:36,680
Cool. And if we want, we can do that syntax up here from the net spec for our functions. 


11079
11:07:36,680 --> 11:07:39,920
For example, for fund it, we could even just copy paste, 


11080
11:07:40,490 --> 11:07:44,060
we would remove title, we would remove author, 


11081
11:07:44,060 --> 11:07:48,710
and we just say add, notice, this function, funds this contract. 


11082
11:07:48,710 --> 11:07:55,640
And we can even leave a little dev thing here to talk about it. 


11083
11:07:55,640 --> 11:07:58,850
Now if we have parameters, you can do apt puram. 


11084
11:07:58,850 --> 11:08:02,660
And say like what the parameter is. 


11085
11:08:02,660 --> 11:08:06,470
And then if we have returns, we can say returns, 


11086
11:08:06,470 --> 11:08:10,400
or returns and then what it returns for the documentation. 


11087
11:08:10,400 --> 11:08:13,400
Since this doesn't have any parameters in here, 


11088
11:08:13,400 --> 11:08:15,980
and doesn't return anything, we can just leave it like this. 


11089
11:08:15,980 --> 11:08:18,680
And great, we've just revamped our contract here 


11090
11:08:18,680 --> 11:08:21,560
to make it a little bit more nicely formatted. Great job. 


11091
11:08:21,560 --> 11:08:24,710
Now, like I said, we actually are going to change the names of our state variables, 


11092
11:08:24,710 --> 11:08:26,900
and we're going to add some functions in here and a little bit. 


11093
11:08:26,900 --> 11:08:29,300
So if we're following with the GitHub repo,


11094
11:08:29,330 --> 11:08:31,940
