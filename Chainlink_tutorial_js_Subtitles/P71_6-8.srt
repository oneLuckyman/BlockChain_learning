9211
09:09:42,970 --> 09:09:45,550
That it looks like we ran into this error, no such file or directory, 
啊，看来我们遇到了报错，“没有这样的文件或目录”

9212
09:09:45,550 --> 09:09:48,610
it looks like our code might not have compiled correctly here. 
看起来我们的代码可能没有正确编译

9213
09:09:48,610 --> 09:09:51,430
So here's what I'm gonna do. 
这里我打算这么做

9214
09:09:51,430 --> 09:09:55,180
We're gonna go ahead and delete our artifacts to trash. 
我要删除我们的 "artifacts"，移动到回收站

9215
09:09:55,180 --> 09:09:58,810
We're gonna delete our cache as well. 
同时也删除我们的 "cache"

9216
09:09:58,810 --> 09:10:01,540
And we're going to try rerunning this 
接着我会尝试重新运行一下这个

9217
09:10:01,540 --> 09:10:04,870
whenever you run a script with the hard drive command Hardhead will automatically recompile it for you, 
每当你使用 Hardhat 命令运行脚本时，Hardhat 都会自动为你重新编译一次

9218
09:10:04,870 --> 09:10:08,170
especially if there's no artifacts folder. 
尤其是没有 "artifacts" 文件夹的时候

9219
09:10:08,170 --> 09:10:11,050
So we're going to rerun this command and heartbeat, it's going to compile first 
所以我们要重新运行一下这个命令，并且 Hardhat 会首先进行编译

9220
09:10:11,050 --> 09:10:14,320
and we can see that it does exactly that. 
可以看到它确实是这样的

9221
09:10:15,010 --> 09:10:17,830
And then it's going to go ahead and redeploy. 
接着它就会继续重新部署

9222
09:10:17,830 --> 09:10:26,170
Hopefully this time, it should be able to find the contract that had just compiled 
希望这一次，它能找到刚刚编译好的合约

9223
09:10:26,170 --> 09:10:29,200
looks like this time after I deleted the artifacts folder, 
看来这一次，在我删掉 "artifacts" 文件夹后

9224
09:10:29,200 --> 09:10:32,680
we actually did indeed get some successful compilation. 
我们确实成功完成了编译

9225
09:10:32,680 --> 09:10:35,770
And we can see here successfully submitted source code for contract 
并且我们可以看到，“成功提交了合约的源代码”

9226
09:10:35,770 --> 09:10:38,290
or verification on the block explore waiting for verification results,
于区块浏览器上进行验证，正在等待验证结果

9227
09:10:38,800 --> 09:10:41,590
successfully verified contracts simple storage on ether scan,
成功在 etherscan 上验证了 SimpleStorage 合约

9228
09:10:41,890 --> 09:10:45,040
and even gives us a link that we can go ahead and Command click or control click into. 
它甚至还给了我们一个链接，使用 "Command" 点击或 "Ctrl" 点击以进入

9229
09:10:45,040 --> 09:10:48,400
And we can see the contract indeed being verified. 
并且我们可以看到合约确实已经被验证了

9230
09:10:48,400 --> 09:10:55,360
This is awesome. 
真是太棒了
