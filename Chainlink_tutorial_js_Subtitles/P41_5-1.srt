5567
05:30:47,500 --> 05:30:50,470
Awesome, you've done fantastically to get this far.
太棒了，能走这么远你已经做得很好了

5568
05:30:50,800 --> 05:30:54,100
And for this section before we get started actually moving over to Hardhead. And moving over to JavaScript and understanding why we need to do that. 
在我们实际转移到 Hardhat 和 JavaScript 并理解为什么要做这些的之前这一节

5569
05:30:54,100 --> 05:30:57,040



5570
05:30:57,040 --> 05:31:00,280
Let's understand a little bit about getting help and running into problems. 
让我们先来了解一下如何寻求帮助并解决问题

5571
05:31:00,310 --> 05:31:03,460
So let's say we have our Funmi contract here that we just worked on. 
就拿我们刚刚创建的这个 FundMe 合约来说

5572
05:31:03,460 --> 05:31:07,090
And we run into an error. 
如果我们遇到了一个错误

5573
05:31:07,090 --> 05:31:11,020
Let's say for example, we forgot the payable keyword,
比方说，我们忘记 payable 关键字了

5574
05:31:11,230 --> 05:31:15,130
right, and we go ahead and compile this 
好的，让我们继续并且编译它

5575
05:31:15,130 --> 05:31:18,880
compile fund, we did so. 
编译 FundMe.sol

5576
05:31:18,880 --> 05:31:20,950
And we scroll down. And we see obviously, we have two errors here, 
接着我们向下滚动，可以看到，这里我们有了两个错误

5577
05:31:20,950 --> 05:31:25,480
right, we're getting some errors, and we scroll down. 
是的，我们收到了一些报错，接着向下滚动

5578
05:31:25,480 --> 05:31:28,630
And we see type error message dot value and call value can only be used and payable public functions, 
我们可以看到类型错误(TypeError)，msg.value 和 callvalue() 只能在 payable public 函数中使用

5579
05:31:28,630 --> 05:31:31,540
make the function payable or using an internal function to avoid this error. 
使这个函数成为 payable 的，或者使用 internal 函数来避免此错误

5580
05:31:31,540 --> 05:31:34,030
And then it goes ahead and gives the line that's airing. 
然后它继续并给出了错误出现在哪一行

5581
05:31:34,030 --> 05:31:38,230
Now this error is pretty clear, this error code is pretty clear. 
现在这个报错就很清楚了，错误代码非常清晰

5582
05:31:38,230 --> 05:31:41,530
It's saying Hey, make the function payable, 
它在说，嘿，让这个函数变成 payable 的

5583
05:31:41,530 --> 05:31:44,200
or using an internal function to avoid this error, right? 
或者使用 internal 函数来避免此错误，对吧？

5584
05:31:44,200 --> 05:31:48,220
This should be pretty easy to to add payable, and then recompile and be good to go. 
很简单地在这里加上 payable，然后重新编译就可以了

5585
05:31:48,220 --> 05:31:51,010
And this is actually a good example of what to do when you run into errors. 
这是一个很好的例子，它说明了当你遇到错误时该怎么做

5586
05:31:51,010 --> 05:31:53,680
When you run into errors. The first thing you want to do is 
当你遇到错误时，第一件要做的事就是

5587
05:31:53,680 --> 05:31:56,290
you want to try to figure out exactly what's going on yourself based off of what the error says. 
你要根据错误信息找出到底发生了什么

5588
05:31:56,290 --> 05:32:00,310
This one's pretty straightforward, 
这个例子比较简单，

5589
05:32:00,310 --> 05:32:02,740
but some of them can be a little bit more obscure 
但有一些也可能会比较晦涩

5590
05:32:02,740 --> 05:32:06,790
step one when trying to get unblocked trying to tinker and figure out errors yourself, right? 
突破难题的第一步就是尝试自己纠正并解决错误，对吧？

5591
05:32:06,790 --> 05:32:10,240
Because maybe you go okay, I'll make this payable, right? 
你可能会说，好吧，我在这里加上 payable 对吧？

5592
05:32:10,240 --> 05:32:14,410
And you go to save. 
接着把它保存

5593
05:32:14,410 --> 05:32:17,020
And then it gives a different error saying, hey, you know, payable doesn't go here. 
然后它就会报一个不同的错说，嘿，你得知道，payable 不是放在这里的

5594
05:32:17,020 --> 05:32:21,460
You resave you recompile it goes, Hey, we're still missing that payable thing. 
重新保存重新编译，它会说，嘿，我们还是没有找到 payable 

5595
05:32:21,460 --> 05:32:24,430
First step is always going to be trying to tinker and figure it out yourself. 
第一步总是得依靠自己尝试纠正并解决问题

5596
05:32:24,430 --> 05:32:27,340
For this course, 
在这门课上

5597
05:32:27,340 --> 05:32:31,750
I want you to limit tinkering, slash triaging to 20 minutes, 
我希望你把纠错时间控制在 20 分钟以内

5598
05:32:31,750 --> 05:32:36,490
if you take more than 20 minutes to tinker and triage, then move on to the next step. 
如果你花了 20 分钟时间还没有完成纠错，那么就要进入到下一步了

5599
05:32:36,610 --> 05:32:40,150
But I also want you to take at least 15 minutes yourself 
但我仍然希望你至少要花 15 分钟时间来尝试独立解决

5600
05:32:40,150 --> 05:32:48,700
or be 100% Sure, you exhausted all options, you're completely out of ideas. 
或者你已经 100% 确定，你已经尝试了所有的选择，没有任何新的想法了

5601
05:32:48,700 --> 05:32:51,910
So typically try to tinker try some stuff for 15 minutes. 
所以一般来说，试着用 15 分钟的时间来进行纠错

5602
05:32:51,910 --> 05:32:55,360
And if you're under 15 minutes, and you're saying, 
或者如果还不到 15 分钟，你就感觉

5603
05:32:55,360 --> 05:32:58,420
Hey, I'm 100% Certain I've tried everything that I can think of, 
嘿，我已经百分之百确定我已经尝试了所有我能想到的方法了

5604
05:32:58,420 --> 05:33:01,330
then you can move on to the next step. 
那么你就可以转移到下一步了

5605
05:33:01,330 --> 05:33:04,090
So step one, when you run into errors is always 
所以第一步，当你遇到错误时你得先

5606
05:33:04,090 --> 05:33:11,200
going to be tinker and try to pinpoint exactly what's going on. 
独自尝试修改错误并找出到底发生了什么事

5607
05:33:11,200 --> 05:33:14,320
Try to pinpoint exactly what's going wrong. 
试着准确地指出到底哪里发生了问题

5608
05:33:14,320 --> 05:33:16,960
Step two, let's say you tinkered and you tried payable all over the place, 
第二步，假设你已经尽可能地纠错并在各种地方都尝试添加了 payable 

5609
05:33:16,960 --> 05:33:19,960
and you couldn't figure out what this error was and how to debug this here. 
但你仍然不知道到底哪里出了错并且不知道该怎么调试这个 bug

5610
05:33:19,960 --> 05:33:24,790
Step two is always going to be Google the exact error and see if you can learn from that. 
第二步就是要用 Google 进行精准纠错，并且看看你是否可以从中学到些什么

5611
05:33:24,790 --> 05:33:27,070
So zoom out a little bit, I'll roll my mouse over this, grab this, 
缩小一点，把鼠标移到这里，选中这些

5612
05:33:27,070 --> 05:33:32,440
copy it, or quotes around it, and do exactly that, 
复制它们，或者加上引号，然后检索

5613
05:33:32,440 --> 05:33:36,250
in Google search that exact error
在 Google 中精准寻找该错误

5614
05:33:36,280 --> 05:33:38,920
and take some time going through Google going through Stack Overflow going through Stack Exchange eath, 
花一些时间去 Google 去 Stack Overflow 去 Stack Exchange Eth

5615
05:33:38,920 --> 05:33:41,710
and look to see if somebody has asked this question already. 
看看有没有人已经问过这个问题了

5616
05:33:41,710 --> 05:33:44,140
And it looks like down here 
看起来是在这里

5617
05:33:44,140 --> 05:33:47,230
looks like somebody has 
看来其他人也遇到了

5618
05:33:47,230 --> 05:33:49,780
type error missed a value and call though can only be used on PayPal public functions. 
类型错误："msg.value" 和 "callvalue()" 只能在 payable public 函数中使用

5619
05:33:49,780 --> 05:33:53,740
And if we scroll down, we see that somebody ran into exactly this. 
如果我们往下滚动，可以看到有些人正好也遇到了这个问题

5620
05:33:53,740 --> 05:33:56,470
And they went ahead and solved it. 
并且他们把这个问题给解决了

5621
05:33:56,470 --> 05:33:59,620
They go, I realized my mistake, I needed to add the PayPal keyword to my own implementation. 
他们说，我意识到了自己的错误，我需要在我的实现中添加 payable 关键字

5622
05:33:59,620 --> 05:34:02,440
And they go ahead in this question, they've added the payable. 
接着他们继续，在这个问题下他们添加了 payable 

5623
05:34:02,440 --> 05:34:05,710
And hopefully this would give you the insight to say, 
希望这能让你明白

5624
05:34:05,710 --> 05:34:08,590
Ah, okay, great. I do need to come back here and add payable. 
啊，很好，我需要回到这里并且添加上 payable 

5625
05:34:08,590 --> 05:34:11,710
Let's say this StackOverflow question didn't show up. Right? 
假如 Stack Overflow 上并没有这个问题

5626
05:34:11,710 --> 05:34:14,620
This forum wasn't here. What do we do next?
没有这样一个讨论区，下一步该怎么办

5627
05:34:14,650 --> 05:34:19,270
So step one, tinker. Step two, Google the exact error, 
第一步，改错，第二步，使用 Google 精准纠错

5628
05:34:19,270 --> 05:34:25,120
I'm going to do a step 2.5 That only is for this class, 
现在我要做的第 2.5 步只适用于这门课

5629
05:34:25,120 --> 05:34:30,460
go to our GitHub, repo discussions, and or updates for this course,
去到我们的 Github 仓库的讨论区，或者这门课的更新

5630
05:34:30,460 --> 05:34:34,330
specifically, go to this GitHub repo, full blockchain solidity course, Jas, 
特别是，去这个 Github 仓库，full-blockchain-solidity-course-js

5631
05:34:34,330 --> 05:34:36,400
it'll look a little bit different when you all get to it. 
当你打开这里的时候界面可能会有一些不同

5632
05:34:36,400 --> 05:34:39,850
But come to this repo, and look in this chronological update section 
不过最好是来看看这个仓库，按照时间顺序查看更新的内容

5633
05:34:39,880 --> 05:34:43,960
to see if there's an update on that section that you're doing. 
看看有没有更新你正在做的部分

5634
05:34:43,960 --> 05:34:46,390
Obviously, since I'm recording right now, there's no update. 
很明显，因为我现在还在录制所以这里没有什么更新

5635
05:34:46,390 --> 05:34:50,050
And if you don't get anything, feel free to jump into the discussion section. 
如果你什么都没找到的话，请随时到讨论区看看

5636
05:34:50,050 --> 05:34:52,990
And ask a question in here, right,
并在这里提出问题

5637
05:34:52,990 --> 05:34:55,480
there's going to be a community of people looking to help each other out and looking to make this a lot of fun. 
社区里会有人帮你一起看看，并让事情有趣起来

5638
05:34:55,480 --> 05:34:58,390
And the reason I say 2.5 is because 
我之所以说这是第 2.5 步是因为

5639
05:34:58,390 --> 05:35:02,200
in the real world, you're not going to have our GitHub repo, 
在实际工作中，你就没有我们的 Github 仓库了

5640
05:35:02,200 --> 05:35:05,530
when working on stuff outside of this course, 
当你在做本课程之外的工作时

5641
05:35:05,530 --> 05:35:09,100
you're not going to have this GitHub repo. 
你就没有这样的 Github 仓库可供参考了

5642
05:35:09,100 --> 05:35:11,500
So instead, in the real world, I'm still going to give you the keys, 
所以作为替代，在实际工作中，我还是会给你一些其他诀窍

5643
05:35:11,500 --> 05:35:15,070
I'm going to give you what it takes to still unblock yourself on anything. 
我仍然会告诉你消除自身障碍的一切方法

5644
05:35:15,100 --> 05:35:19,210
Okay. So number three is going to be asked a question on a forum, 
好了，所以第三点就是在论坛上进行提问

5645
05:35:19,690 --> 05:35:27,400
like stack, exchange eath and Stack Overflow. 
比如 Stack Exchange ETH 和 Stack Overflow

5646
05:35:27,430 --> 05:35:31,870
Stack Overflow is a question and answering tech forum like this, right? 
Stack Overflow 是一个提供提问和解答的技术论坛，比如这个

5647
05:35:31,900 --> 05:35:35,290
You can ask tech questions, and then you can answer them as well. 
你可以提出技术问题，也可以在上面进行回答

5648
05:35:35,290 --> 05:35:38,110
And as you can see, when you search for these issues, they'll show up 
正如你所看到的，当你搜索这些问题时，它们就会出现

5649
05:35:38,110 --> 05:35:41,890
so Stack Overflow is more for general Role programming questions 
所以 Stack Overflow 更适用于一般的编程问题

5650
05:35:41,890 --> 05:35:45,940
and Stack Exchange Aetherium or Stack Exchange eath Aetherium Stack Exchange, 
而 Stack Exchange Ethereum 或者说 Stack Exchange Eth，Ethereum Stack Exchange

5651
05:35:45,970 --> 05:35:50,410
this is for more Aetherium or EVM based question 
它更多的是以太坊或者 EVM 的问题为主

5652
05:35:50,410 --> 05:35:53,860
and all the solidity code that we're gonna be working with, 
所有我们要处理的 Solidity 代码

5653
05:35:53,860 --> 05:35:56,710
whether it's polygon, whether it's avalanche, whether it's whatever, 
无论是在 Polygon 还是 Avalanche 或者别的什么上

5654
05:35:56,710 --> 05:35:59,920
those questions are going to be valid here, and you can ask here. 
这些问题都是可行的，能够在这里进行提问的

5655
05:35:59,920 --> 05:36:03,040
So what you'd want to do is you'd want to sign up or log in, 
所以你要做的就是注册或者登录

5656
05:36:03,040 --> 05:36:06,190
and ask and format your questions on these forms, 
然后在论坛上格式化地提出你的问题

5657
05:36:06,190 --> 05:36:09,070
you'll want to sign up for GitHub, 
你得注册一下 Github

5658
05:36:09,070 --> 05:36:11,650
you want to sign up for Stack Exchange, 
还要注册一下 Stack Exchange

5659
05:36:11,650 --> 05:36:14,260
you'll want to sign up for Stack Overflow, 
还要注册 Stack Overflow

5660
05:36:14,590 --> 05:36:17,440
so you can participate in these forums. 
这样你才能加入到这些论坛里来

5661
05:36:17,440 --> 05:36:20,890
In fact, if you haven't already, let's sign up for GitHub right now. 
如果你现在还没有注册过 Github 的话，那我们现在就注册一下吧

5662
05:36:20,890 --> 05:36:22,990
And let me walk you through formatting one of these questions, 
并且我会告诉你如何格式化地提出问题

5663
05:36:22,990 --> 05:36:25,720
because the better you format your questions, the better chance you have of actually getting the answer. 
因为你提问的格式越好，就越有可能被回答

5664
05:36:25,720 --> 05:36:28,000
And remember, when asking questions on these forums, 
而且要记住，当你在这些论坛提问时

5665
05:36:28,000 --> 05:36:31,870
when asking questions, in these discussion communities,
当你在这些讨论社区提问的时候

5666
05:36:31,930 --> 05:36:34,060
people answer these questions out of the goodness of their heart, right? 
人们之所以回答这些问题是出于他们善良的热心

5667
05:36:34,060 --> 05:36:37,180
So if you don't get a response, there's a chance that maybe nobody knows, 
所以你要是没有得到回应，有可能是没人知道答案

5668
05:36:37,180 --> 05:36:40,120
maybe it's your question isn't formatted very well, and etc. 
也可能是你的提问格式不太好，等等

5669
05:36:40,120 --> 05:36:43,630
So we're going to learn how to ask really good questions here. 
所以我们这里要学习一下如何问一个好问题

5670
05:36:43,630 --> 05:36:46,270
And if you're new to blockchain, do not skip this section. Okay, 
如果你是个区块链新手的话，请不要跳过这一部分，好吗

5671
05:36:46,270 --> 05:36:49,030
this is going to be that piece that's going to give you the superpower 
它能让你获得一种超能力

5672
05:36:49,030 --> 05:36:51,370
to unblock yourself from any coding issue you run into. 
让你能够从遇到的任何代码问题中解脱出来

5673
05:36:51,370 --> 05:36:54,490
So don't skip this powerup. Be sure to follow along. 
所以不要跳过这一部分，一定要跟着做

5674
05:36:54,490 --> 05:36:57,220
Okay. So if you don't have a GitHub already, 
好了，如果你还没有 Github 账号

5675
05:36:57,220 --> 05:36:59,920
you do need an email to get started. 
你需要一个电子邮箱才能开始

5676
05:37:00,220 --> 05:37:03,190
So I'm going to go ahead and sign in, I made a burner account just for this video. 
现在我要登录邮箱了，我为这个视频创建了一个一次性账号

5677
05:37:03,190 --> 05:37:05,440
So what we're gonna do, we're gonna go ahead and sign up 
所以我们现在要做的就是，注册账号

5678
05:37:05,440 --> 05:37:08,020
GitHub, enter your email
进入 Github，输入你的邮箱

5679

05:37:20,800 --> 05:37:25,570
and we got our launch code here, paste it in. 
这里是我们的验证码，复制过来

5682
05:37:25,570 --> 05:37:32,290
And so a little bit of information. 
接着提供一些信息

5683
05:37:32,290 --> 05:37:35,920
We're going to choose the free version. 
我们要选择这个免费版本

5684
05:37:35,920 --> 05:37:38,740
and fantastic. We've now created a GitHub profile. 
非常棒，我们现在已经创建好了一个 Github 账号

5685
05:37:39,070 --> 05:37:41,920
Now back over in the smart contract kid full blockchain solidity course, Jas, 
现在回到 smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js

5686
05:37:41,920 --> 05:37:44,230
I'm going to create a new discussion, a new thread, 
我现在要创建一个新讨论(New discussion)，一个新的贴子

5687
05:37:44,230 --> 05:37:47,950

我希望你们都可以发表一下评论，以确保你们确实理解了该如何格式化地提问，OKay？

5688
05:37:47,950 --> 05:37:53,770
general thread for practicing. Question formatting. Oops. 
练习提问格式的通用贴子！喔！！

5689
05:37:53,800 --> 05:37:57,190
And so let's go back here. 
然后让我们回到这里

5690
05:37:57,220 --> 05:38:00,190
So first, I'm going to format this question poorly, two ways, 
首先我会把问题的格式写的很糟糕，有两种方式

5691
05:38:00,190 --> 05:38:03,430
and then we're gonna format it really, really well. 
接着我会把格式改的非常非常好

5692
05:38:03,490 --> 05:38:07,060
So the first way we're going to format it poorly, is by not giving enough information. 
第一种糟糕的格式是，没有提供足够的信息

5693
05:38:07,060 --> 05:38:11,260
So what we're going to do is I'm gonna just copy this issue 
我们要做的是，复制这一段

5694
05:38:11,290 --> 05:38:19,060
we're going to do is we'll just say like, Hey, I'm having trouble with remix and an error. Can someone help me? 
接着要做的就是说，嘿，我在使用 remix 的时候报了一个错，谁能来帮帮我？

5695
05:38:19,060 --> 05:38:23,410
Why is this not a well formatted question? 
为什么这不是一个格式良好的问题

5696
05:38:23,410 --> 05:38:27,220
If this is my question, there's not nearly enough information here, 
如果这就是我的问题，那么这里并没有包含足够的信息

5697
05:38:27,220 --> 05:38:30,700
I, as a helper, have no idea what this person's asking. 
如果我是来帮忙的，那我根本就无法知道这个人到底在问什么

5698
05:38:30,700 --> 05:38:34,630
So let's do something else. What I'm going to do is 
我们再来做点别的，这回我们要做的是

5699
05:38:34,630 --> 05:38:38,800
I'm going to copy this entire contract all the fun, read outsole, paste it in here,
我要把整个 FundMe.sol 里的合约，都复制到这里

5700
05:38:39,040 --> 05:38:46,000
and go, Hi, I'm having issues here. Can someone help? 
接着说，嗨，我遇到了一些问题，谁能来帮帮我

5701
05:38:46,000 --> 05:38:49,450
I'm gonna head start discussion 
然后点击这里的 Start discussion

5702
05:38:49,450 --> 05:38:52,120
here want to hit start discussion, it formats this all weird. 
当我点击了 Start discussion 之后，这里的格式变得非常奇怪

5703
05:38:52,150 --> 05:38:56,140
And once again, there's not really enough information here. I don't know what the issue is. 
并且，这里还是没有足够的信息，我还是不知道问题出在了哪里

5704
05:38:56,140 --> 05:38:58,150
But at least with this one, we have some code, we have some way to actually debug. 
但是至少相比第一个来说，这里有代码了，我们能够进行一些 debug 操作

5705
05:38:58,150 --> 05:39:00,490
So this is a little bit better. But it's still not that good. 
这样的话略微好一点，但仍然不是太好

5706
05:39:00,490 --> 05:39:03,130
Let's go ahead and edit this. To make this even better. 
我们来继续编辑它，让他变得更好一点

5707
05:39:03,130 --> 05:39:06,640
We hit three dots, we can hit edit, 
点击这里的三个点，然后点击 Edit

5708
05:39:06,640 --> 05:39:10,870
what we can do is we can use something called Markdown syntax, 
我们要做的是使用一种名为 Markdown 的语法

5709
05:39:10,930 --> 05:39:13,480
and highly recommend learning a little bit of markdown, 
我强烈建议大家学习一些 Markdown 的用法

5710
05:39:13,480 --> 05:39:17,470
it's basically some syntax help make discussions on GitHub. 
基本上就是一些帮助在 Github 上进行讨论的语法

5711
05:39:17,650 --> 05:39:21,400
And also, questions on Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange a lot easier. 
并且同样使得在 Stack Overflow 和 Stack Exchange 上的提问容易了许多

5712
05:39:21,400 --> 05:39:25,450
So we're going to format this code 
我们现在要把代码格式化

5713
05:39:25,510 --> 05:39:31,090
by adding these three backticks at the start, 
方法是在代码开头添加三个点(译者注：即键盘左上角在 Esc 下面 Tab 上面，同时是波浪线的按键)

5714
05:39:31,090 --> 05:39:34,300
and then also at the end of our code. 
然后在代码结尾处也是一样

5715
05:39:34,300 --> 05:39:40,990
And then additionally, next, the first three backticks, we're going to type so lid did T 
另外，接下来我们还要在开头的三个点后面输入 so-li-di-ty 

5716
05:39:40,990 --> 05:39:44,830
which tells the format or to to use solidity to format this code here. 
以此表明此处格式化的是 solidity 代码

5717
05:39:44,830 --> 05:39:49,300
Now if we update discussion, we notice we get some nice highlighting here. 
现在如果我们更新这个 discussion，我们注意到这里有一些高亮内容

5718
05:39:49,300 --> 05:39:53,950
So this becomes much, much easier to read. 
这样就变得更加容易阅读了

5719
05:39:53,950 --> 05:39:57,130
Right? This is way easier to read now than than it was before. 
好了，现在读起来比以前容易多了

5720
05:39:57,130 --> 05:40:00,100
However, it's still not specific enough. 
但是，它还是不够具体

5721
05:40:00,100 --> 05:40:03,370
We've given a ton of code here, and we haven't given the specific answer. 
我们给出了大量的代码，但没有给出具体的问题

5722
05:40:03,550 --> 05:40:06,730
So this is gonna be really hard for somebody to answer. 
所以对很多人来说这个提问都很难回答

5723
05:40:06,730 --> 05:40:10,780
So let's make this more specific. So let's edit this question again. And let's specify, 
那么我们来把它变得更具体一些，让我们再编辑一次这个问题，把它变得更具体一些

5724
05:40:10,780 --> 05:40:15,640
so we see here, our issue is specifically on this function. 
可以看到，我们的问题出在这个函数上

5725
05:40:15,640 --> 05:40:18,340
We're going to copy this function and we're going to delete everything else in here.
我们要把这个函数复制过来，先把这里所有的东西都删掉

5726
05:40:19,630 --> 05:40:23,290
And now we have just this code inside of here. 
现在我们只放了这么一小段代码在这里

5727
05:40:23,290 --> 05:40:26,500
Now we're going to make this really specific. 
现在我要让它变得更具体一些

5728
05:40:26,500 --> 05:40:31,300
We're going to say, on this function, I'm running into an error. 
我们会说，在这个函数中，我遇到了一个错误

5729
05:40:31,300 --> 05:40:33,220
And then what we're going to do is we're going to come back here, we're going to roll the over this. 
然后我们要做的就是回到这边来，选中这一部分

5730
05:40:33,220 --> 05:40:36,100
We're going to copy this 
我们要复制这一段

5731
05:40:36,100 --> 05:40:39,250
we could have pull our code if we want but we're going to format this error like this.
如果我们想的话，也可以把代码提取过来，但是我们这里就把报错信息格式化就行了

5732
05:40:39,580 --> 05:40:43,960
And then we're gonna say Can someone tell me What's going on? Update? 
然后说，谁能来告诉我一下这是怎么回事？更新

5733
05:40:44,770 --> 05:40:49,810
Now this is a much, much easier question to debug. Right?
现在这就是一个非常非常容易 debug 的问题了，对吧

5734
05:40:49,810 --> 05:40:52,630
We have some minimalistic code, we have the error that we're getting. 
我们的代码非常简洁，并且把报错信息也放上了

5735
05:40:52,630 --> 05:40:56,080
And we have Can someone tell me what's going on?
并且还问了“谁能告诉我这是怎么回事？”

5736
05:40:56,170 --> 05:41:00,100
Obviously, the answer to this would be to add payable to this.
显然，这个问题的答案就是把 payable 给加到这里

5737
05:41:00,130 --> 05:41:02,110
And that's what somebody would say, hey, like, you need to add payable to this, 
有人来回答的话就会说，嘿，你好像要在这里加上 payable 

5738
05:41:02,110 --> 05:41:04,960
I want you all to practice doing some formatting, 
我希望你们都能练习一下这个格式

5739
05:41:04,960 --> 05:41:08,380
go ahead and add a comment on this with your own formatted question. 
并且按照格式在这里回复一个你自己的问题

5740
05:41:08,380 --> 05:41:11,470
So that you understand how to actually do the formatting. 
这样你就能理解如何使用这个格式了

5741
05:41:11,470 --> 05:41:14,590
And this markdown format. It's this format here, 
并且，这个 markdown 格式，就是这里的这个格式

5742
05:41:14,590 --> 05:41:17,290
that's gonna be the exact same for asking questions on Stack Overflow, or Stack Exchange 
同样也适用于在 Stack Overflow 或 Stack Exchange 上提问

5743
05:41:17,290 --> 05:41:21,070
for this course, go ahead and practice if you want to create more new discussions, 
对本课程来说，如果你想创建更多的新讨论区，请继续练习

5744
05:41:21,070 --> 05:41:24,730
feel free to create new discussions. 
你可以随意创建创建新的讨论区

5745
05:41:24,730 --> 05:41:27,280
If you want to use Stack Overflow or Stack Exchange eath 
如果你想要使用 Stack Overflow 或 Stack Exchange Eth 的话

5746
05:41:27,280 --> 05:41:31,030
actually highly recommend you Stack Overflow or Stack Exchange eath as well, 
其实我也更推荐你使用 Stack Overflow 或 Stack Exchange Eth

5747
05:41:31,030 --> 05:41:33,790
because those are gonna get indexed a lot better than GitHub here.
因为那里的索引要比 Github 这里好多了

5748
05:41:33,790 --> 05:41:36,760



5749
05:41:37,360 --> 05:41:39,850
However, feel free to ask questions, obviously, in this GitHub as well. 
不过，显然在 Github 上你也是可以自由提问的

5750
05:41:39,850 --> 05:41:42,580
Now that I've given you kind of the basics rundown, 
现在我已经告诉了你们一些基本要点

5751
05:41:42,580 --> 05:41:45,610
we're going to watch a video that I made that 
接下来我们要来看一段我制作的视频

5752
05:41:45,610 --> 05:41:48,820
goes even deeper into why and how to format all these questions and what to use. 
它将更深入地讲解为什么还有如何设置问题的格式，以及要使用什么工具

5753
05:41:48,820 --> 05:41:50,650
So let's go ahead and watch that. 
让我们继续吧，来看看它

5754
05:41:50,739 --> 05:42:00,009
Every developer has run into this. 
每一名开发者都在追求一个目标

5755
05:42:00,009 --> 05:42:01,959
Something breaks or maybe you don't know something, 
出了些问题也可能你根本不知道出了什么问题

5756
05:42:01,959 --> 05:42:04,809
but you don't have time to let these stop you. 
但你没有时间让这些妨碍你

5757
05:42:04,809 --> 05:42:08,379
There are a series of steps that one should take to maximize one's chances of solving any coding problem, 
这里有一系列步骤可以让一个人最大限度地提升解决代码问题的能力

5758
05:42:08,379 --> 05:42:11,499
but you'd be surprised at how few developers currently use the superpower effectively, 
但你会惊讶地发现，目前只有很少的开发者能够有效地使用这份超能力

5759
05:42:11,499 --> 05:42:14,289
our first one we'll spend the least time on, 
我们的第一步花的时间最少

5760
05:42:14,289 --> 05:42:16,629
because it's just tinker and experiment.
因为就只是纠错和实验

5761
05:42:16,809 --> 05:42:19,059
When you run into an issue. Keep trying different things you think might work, 
当你遇到问题的时候，尝试你认为可能有效的所有不同的方法

5762
05:42:19,089 --> 05:42:21,519
maybe try doing print statements throughout the file, learn some debugging tips, 
可以试试对整个文件执行打印(print)语句，或是学习一些其他 debug 技巧

5763
05:42:21,519 --> 05:42:23,829
but don't be so cocky that you only do this first step. 
但是不要骄傲地认为你只用做这第一步就够了

5764
05:42:23,829 --> 05:42:27,639
And this shouldn't just be random running around. 
而且不要随意地胡乱尝试

5765
05:42:27,639 --> 05:42:30,309
This should be trying to pinpoint exactly what's going wrong in your code, 
你应该尽可能精准地找到代码出错的地方 

5766
05:42:30,309 --> 05:42:33,639
so that you can either ask an effective question, 
这样你就可以提出一个高效的问题了

5767
05:42:33,639 --> 05:42:36,279
or figure it out yourself. 
或者干脆自己就给解决了

5768
05:42:36,279 --> 05:42:39,909
So pinpoint exactly what's going wrong, 
所以请精准地找到问题出在了哪里

5769
05:42:39,909 --> 05:42:42,699
because you'll need it for the next steps. Anyways, 
因为接下来的步骤你无论如何都需要它

5770
05:42:42,699 --> 05:42:46,659
next, check the documentation. 
下一步，检查文档

5771
05:42:46,659 --> 05:42:49,689
Not all tools have good documentation. 
并不是所有工具都有十分完善的文档

5772
05:42:49,689 --> 05:42:52,599
But taking some time to explore documentation can be a quick way to find your answer, 
但花点时间来研究文档是找到答案的一个快速方法

5773
05:42:52,599 --> 05:42:55,209
you'll want to learn how to search a webpage with Command F or Control F. 
你要学习一下如何使用 "Command F" 或 "Ctrl F"

5774
05:42:55,209 --> 05:42:58,569
That way, you can look for specific keywords on a page, 
这样，你就可以在页面上寻找特定的关键字

5775
05:42:58,569 --> 05:43:01,119
or hopefully they have a good search bar that works well. 
或者祈祷他们有一个好用的搜索栏

5776
05:43:01,119 --> 05:43:03,879
Sometimes documentation can be really dense. 
有的时候文档可能真的很繁复

5777
05:43:03,879 --> 05:43:06,669
So maybe you'll move to the next step, which is doing a web search. 
所以你就需要进入到下一阶段，也就是到网络上搜索

5778
05:43:06,669 --> 05:43:09,969
At the end of the day, good software engineers are secretly just professional Googlers. 
说到底，优秀的软件工程师私下里只是个专业的谷歌人

5779
05:43:09,969 --> 05:43:12,369
And this is one of their most powerful tools, 
这是他们最强大的工具之一

5780
05:43:12,369 --> 05:43:15,459
being able to search the web for somebody else who has already run into the problem that you've just run into, and then solved it. 
你能够在网上搜索到你遇到的问题，这些问题其他人很可能已经遇到过并解决了

5781
05:43:15,459 --> 05:43:17,919
Most search engines like Google have tools 
大多数搜索引擎比如 Google 都有一些实用工具

5782
05:43:17,919 --> 05:43:20,649
you can use to get even more specific about what you're looking for. 
你可以用它们来更具体地检索你要找的东西

5783
05:43:20,649 --> 05:43:23,889
Often for specific errors, the best thing to do 
通常来说针对具体的问题，最好的方法就是

5784
05:43:23,919 --> 05:43:26,859
is actually just copy the exact error and paste it in the search bar with quotes 
把错误信息复制粘贴到搜索栏并加上引号

5785
05:43:26,859 --> 05:43:29,439
or use the Asterix in spots, your error might be too specific. 
或者在你可能出错的地方使用星号，如果不想过于具体的话

5786
05:43:29,439 --> 05:43:32,259
Most of the results you'll get will be from forums and q&a sites, 
你得到的大多数检索结果都来自于论坛和问答网站

5787
05:43:32,259 --> 05:43:35,979
which leads us to our next step, 
这就引出了我们的下一步

5788
05:43:36,009 --> 05:43:38,949
asking questions in these forums and q&a sites. 
在这些论坛和问答网站上提问

5789
05:43:38,949 --> 05:43:42,999
Just make sure that before you ask a question,
只是在你提问之前得确认

5790
05:43:42,999 --> 05:43:46,779
you've done some ample Googling around yourself beforehand. 
你已经在 Google 上做了充分的检索

5791
05:43:46,779 --> 05:43:49,659
This way you don't waste yours and anybody else's time. 
这样你才不会浪费自己和其他人的时间

5792
05:43:49,659 --> 05:43:52,659
And by asking questions that you swear you will promise me 
而且问过问题之后，希望你能发誓，向我承诺，

5793
05:43:52,659 --> 05:43:56,319
that at some point, you will go back and help other people learn as well got it good. 
总有一天，你也会回去帮助其他人的学习，明白了？非常好

5794
05:43:56,319 --> 05:43:59,619
Before even asking your question though, we should learn where is going to be the best place to ask. 
在你提问之前，我们首先应该知道哪里才是最好的提问地点

5795
05:43:59,769 --> 05:44:03,879
This is why I've categorized for different types of forums and QA sites, 
这就是为什么我分类了四种不同类型的论坛和问答网站

5796
05:44:03,879 --> 05:44:07,149
feel free to pause to read them over. 
你可以暂停下来阅读一遍

5797
05:44:07,149 --> 05:44:10,029
And here's some specific examples of each one of these 
下面是每一种类型的一些具体例子

5798
05:44:10,029 --> 05:44:13,239
index code base forms like Stack Overflow, 
以索引代码为基础的论坛比如 Stack Overflow

5799
05:44:13,239 --> 05:44:17,439
index repositories like GitHub issues, 
索引仓库的比如 Github 

5800
05:44:17,439 --> 05:44:21,219
index technology, specific forums, like our slash eat dev 
索引特定技术的论坛，比如我们的 /ethdev (译者注：指 Reddit 的以太坊开发者版块，类似于国内常用的贴吧)

5801
05:44:21,249 --> 05:44:24,759
or unindexed discussion platforms like chainlink discord, 
或者不索引什么的讨论平台，比如 Chainlink 的 Discord (译者注：Discord 是一种聊天社区，有些类似于国内常用的 QQ 或微信群)

5802
05:44:24,759 --> 05:44:28,419
one of the key differentiators in these categories is the index keyword.
这些分类的其中一个最重要的区别在于索引内容的不同

5803
05:44:28,449 --> 05:44:31,419
We typically want to ask questions on forums 
我们通常希望在论坛上提出的问题

5804
05:44:31,419 --> 05:44:34,239
that web crawlers have gone through and stuck them in their database or index them 
可以被网络爬虫获取，并把它们放入数据库中或者说索引它们

5805
05:44:34,269 --> 05:44:37,419
this way. And three weeks when we look back at the code that we wrote, 
这样的话，当我们三周后再回顾我们所写的代码时

5806
05:44:37,419 --> 05:44:40,449
we can just Google what was going on when we forget what it does. 
我们就可以在我们忘记它们的用法时 Google 一下了

5807
05:44:40,449 --> 05:44:43,269
And this will help out other developers who run into the same problem, 
这也会帮助到其他遇到相同问题的开发人员

5808
05:44:43,269 --> 05:44:46,359
which in turn, they might go ahead and help you out later. 
他们之后也可能会反过来继续帮到你

5809
05:44:46,359 --> 05:44:49,659
Ideally, most of your questions should be asked on one of these index forms for this reason 
理想情况下，你的大多数问题都应该在这些论坛上提出

5810
05:44:49,689 --> 05:44:52,779
for their searchability and discoverability. 
出于它们的可搜索性和可发现性

5811
05:44:52,779 --> 05:44:54,849
However, at some questions are a better fit for DMS, Twitter or discord that aren't index 
然而，某些问题确实更适合于 DMS, Twitter 或 Discord 这种不设索引的地方

5812
05:44:54,849 --> 05:44:58,329



5813
05:44:58,359 --> 05:45:00,879
and we made a little chart here to figure out where's the best place to post your questions, 
我们做了一个小图表来说明哪里是提问的最佳地点

5814
05:45:00,909 --> 05:45:03,219
feel free to pause the video take a look 
你可以暂停下来看一看

5815
05:45:03,219 --> 05:45:05,409
or read our blog and the descriptions with the picture as well to take another look at it.
或者在阅读我们的博客和图片描述之后再来回看

5816
05:45:05,409 --> 05:45:07,959



5817
05:45:07,989 --> 05:45:10,089
And of course, before actually posting that in one of these forums, 
当然了，在这些论坛提问之前

5818
05:45:10,089 --> 05:45:13,359
be sure to read their rules 
一定要阅读一下它们的论坛规则，

5819
05:45:13,419 --> 05:45:15,849
as they might state that some kind of questions are specifically for Ben. 
因为它们可能会说有些问题是专门禁止的

5820
05:45:15,849 --> 05:45:19,059
But basically the breakdown looks like this. 
基本上来说分类是这样的

5821
05:45:19,059 --> 05:45:23,619
Theoretical big picture or opinionated questions can go great on general q&a forums like Quora 
理论的，宏观的或者观点性的问题可以去一些通用的问答论坛，比如 Quora (译者注：类似于国内常用的知乎)

5822
05:45:23,619 --> 05:45:27,759
or specific technical forums like specific subreddits or discord forums, 
或者是特定的技术论坛比如特定的 Reddit 版块或 Discord 论坛

5823
05:45:27,759 --> 05:45:31,269
specific coding questions can go on these forums as well, 
特定的代码问题也可以发到这些论坛上

5824
05:45:31,269 --> 05:45:35,619
but will often get more eyes on coding forums 
但我们通常会更倾向于发到代码论坛上

5825
05:45:35,649 --> 05:45:38,829
like Stack Overflow or Stack Exchange communities 
比如 Stack Overflow 或 Stack Exchange 社区

5826
05:45:38,829 --> 05:45:41,709
often the question of Oh, should I post this on stack URL? flow or maybe a Stack Exchange community 
经常会有这样的问题，哦！我应该把这个发到 Stack Overflow 还是 Stack Exchange 上

5827
05:45:41,739 --> 05:45:45,249
is incredibly blurry. 
这个问题很模糊

5828
05:45:45,249 --> 05:45:47,979
And sometimes it doesn't really matter which one you post on. 
很多时候你到底在这两个论坛中的哪一个上发帖并不重要

5829
05:45:47,979 --> 05:45:51,489
Now, if you run into a bug or an issue with a technology you're really familiar with, 
现在，如果你遇到的 bug 或问题出自于一种你非常熟悉的技术

5830
05:45:51,489 --> 05:45:54,069
and you think it shouldn't be breaking, 
并且你认为这不是你的原因

5831
05:45:54,069 --> 05:45:57,249
this is your chance to pop an issue into their open source code repository 
那么这就是一个你向他们的开源代码库提出问题的机会

5832
05:45:57,249 --> 05:46:00,609
and potentially improve the tool.
并有可能因此而改进该工具

5833
05:46:00,639 --> 05:46:03,429
They don't have an open source code repository, 
你说他们没有开源代码库？

5834
05:46:03,429 --> 05:46:06,879
you throw that closed source piece of shit into the garbage, 
那你应该把这坨封闭代码的垃圾扔进垃圾堆

5835
05:46:06,879 --> 05:46:09,699
but just kidding closed source Tech has its place in our lives, too. 
不过这只是句玩笑话，封闭式技术在我们的生活中也是有一席之地的

5836
05:46:09,729 --> 05:46:12,489
Additionally, if you're following a tutorial, and they have a Git repo associated with it, 
另外，如果你正在跟随某个教程，并且他们有关联的 Git 仓库

5837
05:46:12,489 --> 05:46:16,179
like all of my videos that do, 
就像我所有的视频那样

5838
05:46:16,179 --> 05:46:19,029
that's gonna be the best place to leave your issues. 
那么那里就是解决你问题最好的地方

5839
05:46:19,029 --> 05:46:22,449
So as much as I hate to say it, putting your issues onto my GitHub repositories 
虽然我不想这么说，但把你的问题放在我的 Github 仓库上

5840
05:46:22,449 --> 05:46:25,869
is going to be much more effective for us answering your questions than posting it in the YouTube comments. 
对我们回答你的问题来说，要比放到 Youtube 评论区中高效得多

5841
05:46:25,869 --> 05:46:29,139
Now finally, Discord, element, email, text message or any other these unindexed chats
最后，Discord，Element，Email，短信或是任何无索引的聊天工具

5842
05:46:29,169 --> 05:46:33,279
are still good places to ask questions, 
也是发问的好地方

5843
05:46:33,309 --> 05:46:36,279
but please try to use them as a last resort. 
但请把它们作为你最后的手段

5844
05:46:36,279 --> 05:46:39,309
And if they do end up answering one of your questions, 
如果他们真的回答了你的问题

5845
05:46:39,309 --> 05:46:42,189
maybe go back and add that question and answer to one of the other forums that we were talking about this way
那么也许你可以把问题和答案添加到我们刚才讨论过的其他论坛上

5846
05:46:42,189 --> 05:46:44,979



5847
05:46:44,979 --> 05:46:47,829
it will be indexed next time you or somebody else, Google's it
这样可以方便其他人以后通过 Google 检索到这个问题

5848
05:46:47,889 --> 05:46:50,199
now these quicker chat forums are places more for 
现在这些快速聊天论坛更多是

5849
05:46:50,199 --> 05:46:53,139
the community to congregate and have quick conversations with each other. 
社区成员聚集和快速交流的地方

5850
05:46:53,139 --> 05:46:56,469
They're places to theory craft, talk about new things coming out new ideas, events, 
这些地方可以用来探讨理论问题，谈论新事物，新想法，新事件

5851
05:46:56,469 --> 05:47:00,669
and other things that shouldn't be indexed by web crawlers. 
以及其他不应该被网络爬虫索引到的东西

5852
05:47:00,669 --> 05:47:03,879
They're also great places to meet and network with people 
这些地方也是与他人会面和交流的好地方

5853
05:47:03,879 --> 05:47:06,819
that you might be able to bounce ideas off directly as you get to know each other, 
你可以在与人相互了解的过程中直接交流想法

5854
05:47:06,819 --> 05:47:09,549
which leads into our last section. 
这就引出了我们的最后一部分

5855
05:47:09,549 --> 05:47:12,759
But before we do that, Oh, do you hear that? 
但在此之前，啊哦！你听到了么

5856
05:47:12,759 --> 05:47:17,109
Oh, that's the video inside another video alarm ringing. 
哦！这是另一个视频里的视频警报响了

5857
05:47:17,109 --> 05:47:20,049
When you ask a question in one of these forums, 
当你在这些论坛中提问时

5858
05:47:20,049 --> 05:47:22,449
the better you format your questions, the better chance you'll have of getting an answered. 
你提问的格式越好，被回答的可能性就越高

5859
05:47:22,449 --> 05:47:25,059
Now there's no bad questions out there. But there are poorly formatted questions.
没有不好的问题，但确实有不好的提问方式

5860
05:47:25,059 --> 05:47:28,299



5861
05:47:28,509 --> 05:47:31,749
So let's teach you how to always ask questions as format as best as possible 
所以让我来教一下你如何尽可能地以最好的格式提问

5862
05:47:31,749 --> 05:47:34,839
to give you the highest chance of making sure they get answered. 
以此来确保问题会尽可能地被回答

5863
05:47:34,839 --> 05:47:37,569
Number one, before asking your question, make sure you followed all the steps in the parent video. 
第一点，在提问之前，确保你遵循了前面视频中的所有步骤

5864
05:47:37,599 --> 05:47:40,689
And you've done some research on this already 
并且已经做了充分的研究

5865
05:47:40,689 --> 05:47:43,449
and make sure the question hasn't already been asked. 
确保这个问题还没有人问过

5866
05:47:43,449 --> 05:47:46,239
Number two, make a title that summarizes the specifics of the question

three introduced the problem before you write any code, 
第三，在你放代码之前大致介绍一下问题的由来

5868
05:47:50,079 --> 05:47:53,619
add minimalistic, reproducible code 
(第四) 添加一段简洁，可复现的代码

5869
05:47:53,649 --> 05:47:57,549
minimalistic code means it's not just a copy paste your entire file. 
代码简洁的意思就是你不要直接复制粘贴你的整个文件

5870
05:47:57,549 --> 05:48:00,549
If you're having problems on one line, 
如果你在某一行遇到了问题

5871
05:48:00,549 --> 05:48:04,809
maybe just post that one line

5872
05:48:04,809 --> 05:48:07,689
reproducible code means that others should be able to run to

05:48:07,689 --> 05:48:11,049
the exact same error that you're running into, 
应当能遇到和你完全相同的错误信息

5874
05:48:11,049 --> 05:48:14,079
or at least post the steps for them to do it. 
或者至少说明一下他们应该做哪些步骤

5875
05:48:14,079 --> 05:48:17,739
This doesn't mean that you should put I was following along Patrick's video and on our five I ran into this problem,
但这意思并不是让你说，我正在看 Patrick 的视频，在视频第五小时的地方我遇到了这个问题

5876
05:48:17,739 --> 05:48:20,799
just watch his video and you'll get there. 
去看一下他的视频你就明白我在说什么了

5877
05:48:20,829 --> 05:48:22,989
As flattering as this is it's not reasonable that everyone is going to have watched my videos, 
虽然这让我受宠若惊，但是让所有人都来看我的视频是不合理的

5878
05:48:22,989 --> 05:48:25,869
even though they should 
即使他们确实应该来看一下

5879
05:48:25,869 --> 05:48:28,329
you want to give the technical steps to reach the error that you've reached. 
你应该给出运行出错误的确切技术步骤

5880
05:48:28,329 --> 05:48:30,999
For those of you watching my Free Code Camp video, 
对于那些观看我 Free Code Camp 视频的人来说

5881
05:48:30,999 --> 05:48:34,689
you're kind of exempt from this, 
你可以不受此限制，

5882
05:48:34,749 --> 05:48:37,809
but you can only say, Hey, I was on our Five on this part of your video inside of our discussions tab of the GitHub repo associated with this course. 
但你只能在我们的与课程关联的 Github 仓库的讨论区说，嘿，我在视频第五小时的这部分...

5883
05:48:37,809 --> 05:48:41,139
So you can do that.
你是可以这样做的

5884
05:48:41,169 --> 05:48:44,169
But only in that GitHub repo associated with this course,
但必须只能是在与课程关联的 Github 仓库里

5885
05:48:44,649 --> 05:48:48,549
learning markdown to format your code, 
(第五) 学习 Markdown 来格式化你的代码

5886
05:48:48,579 --> 05:48:53,379
especially using these three backticks and labeling of the language. 
特别是这种三个点搭配语言标记的语法

5887
05:48:53,379 --> 05:48:56,889
This is a critical piece of formatting your code and will drastically improve on the number of people who answer your questions. 
这是格式化代码的关键，它将极大地提升回答你问题的人数

5888
05:48:56,889 --> 05:48:59,709
Any errors or code should be formatted with this three backticks syntax. 
任何报错信息和代码都应该用这种三个点的语法进行格式化

5889
05:48:59,709 --> 05:49:03,489
And finally, 
最后一点

5890
05:49:03,489 --> 05:49:06,099
often people who care about certain technologies,
通常关注某些技术的人

5891
05:49:06,249 --> 05:49:10,239
monitor specific tags and monitor specific questions being asked about the technologies that they like. 
会留意他们所关注的技术的特定标签 (tag) 和特定问题

5892
05:49:10,239 --> 05:49:12,369
And then finally, again, 
最后再强调一下

5893
05:49:12,369 --> 05:49:15,789
be sure to read the forum's guides before posting 
发帖之前一定要阅读一下论坛的指南

5894
05:49:15,789 --> 05:49:18,729
different forums have different rules about what they want and what they don't want. 
不同的论坛对允许什么不允许什么有不同的规定

5895
05:49:18,729 --> 05:49:21,129
So being familiar will increase your chances of getting an answer. 
熟悉这些会增加你被回答的概率

5896
05:49:21,129 --> 05:49:24,099
All right. So now back to the main video. 
好了，现在回到主视频

5897
05:49:24,099 --> 05:49:26,619
Now a note about Stack Overflow, in particular, 
得特别说一下 Stack Overflow

5898
05:49:26,619 --> 05:49:30,189
Stack Overflow can be a little aggressive, 
Stack Overflow 可能会有点，咄咄逼人

5899
05:49:30,189 --> 05:49:32,649
which is why sometimes posting on specific community forums 
这就是为什么有时在某些特定的社区论坛上发帖

5900
05:49:32,649 --> 05:49:35,289
might be better for your specific technology questions. 
会更好地解决你的特定技术问题

5901
05:49:35,289 --> 05:49:38,079
If you post on Stack Overflow, and you get a ton of down votes on your questions. 
如果你在 Stack Overflow 上发帖，然后你的问题收到了大量点踩的话

5902
05:49:38,079 --> 05:49:41,709
Don't let that bother you. Just take it as a learning opportunity 
别太在意这个事了，就把它当作一个学习机会

5903
05:49:41,709 --> 05:49:44,709
to learn about what Stack Overflow likes and doesn't like 
了解一下 Stack Overflow 偏好什么不偏好什么

5904
05:49:44,709 --> 05:49:48,729
and just keep going but do not let that discourage you.
继续前进，不要气馁

5905
05:49:48,849 --> 05:49:51,879
Okay, well, now that we know where things should go, 
OKay，好了，现在我们知道该去哪里解决问题

5906
05:49:51,879 --> 05:49:55,269
where questions should go and how to actually format them. 
去哪里提问并且是格式工整地提问

5907
05:49:55,269 --> 05:49:57,579
Let's practice let's look at some sample questions that you might have. 
让我们来练习一下，一起来看几个你可能会遇到的例子

5908
05:49:57,579 --> 05:49:59,739
And we'll figure out where we want to put them. 
我们一起来想办法看把它们放到哪里

5909
05:49:59,739 --> 05:50:02,589
So the first one, where does this one go? Feel free to pause and guess yourself. 
那么这是第一个，应该放到哪里呢？暂停一下猜猜看

5910
05:50:02,589 --> 05:50:05,859
So a question like this is going to be great for a Reddit or a discord? Probably more a discord. 
像这样的问题比较适合放到 Reddit 或者 Discord 上对吧？可能更多是 Discord

5911
05:50:05,859 --> 05:50:09,789
Now, this is definitely something that you can search for. Right? 
这绝对是你可以搜索到的东西，对吧？

5912
05:50:09,789 --> 05:50:12,699
So you probably could search for this, find an answer and go from there. 
你可以搜索一下，找到答案，然后根据答案开始学习

5913
05:50:12,699 --> 05:50:15,039



5914
05:50:15,039 --> 05:50:17,499
But maybe you want to ask a buddy or maybe you want to ask a very specific community like our slash eat Dev. 
你也可以问问你的朋友或者问一些特定的社区比如我们的 /ethdev

5915
05:50:17,529 --> 05:50:20,679
Now, of course, if you see this question, 
当然，如果你看到这类问题

5916
05:50:20,679 --> 05:50:22,629
you obviously want to recommend Patrick Collins his YouTube channel. 
很明显，你就可以推荐 Patrick Collins 的 Youtube 频道

5917
05:50:22,629 --> 05:50:25,569
Now how about this question. 
那么这个问题呢？

5918
05:50:25,599 --> 05:50:28,899
Notice its formatting right? The title is nice and big. 
注意，它进行了格式化，对吧？标题又大又好看

5919
05:50:28,989 --> 05:50:32,079
They have a technical command that is formatted properly. 
他们有格式正确的技术指令

5920
05:50:32,079 --> 05:50:34,809
They have Git commit which is formatted properly, where would this go 
他们有正确地格式化了 git commit，这个怎么样

5921
05:50:34,809 --> 05:50:37,719
like this would definitely do very well on a Stack Overflow or an index code based forum 
像这样的问题，在 Stack Overflow 或基于索引代码的论坛上肯定会做得更好

5922
05:50:37,719 --> 05:50:41,409
to very clearly try had to do something technical. 
很明显，他们要做一些技术性的事情

5923
05:50:41,409 --> 05:50:44,829
The problem is laid out very clearly. 
这个问题已经说得很清楚了

5924
05:50:44,829 --> 05:50:47,859
And they've given the command that they're looking to do. 
并且他们也提供了他们想要执行得命令

5925
05:50:47,859 --> 05:50:50,259
Now, how about this one, 
那么这个呢

5926
05:50:50,259 --> 05:50:52,749
something like this could go on either StackOverflow. 
这样的问题可以放在 Stack Overflow 得以太坊版块上

5927
05:50:52,749 --> 05:50:56,049
But it's probably more likely going to go on a GitHub issue for this brownie package. 
但更好的选择是放到 brownie 包的 Github issue 上

5928
05:50:56,049 --> 05:51:00,309
A big difference between code forums and and Git repos like GitHub is 
代码论坛和像 Github 这样的 Git 仓库之间的一个很大的区别就是

5929
05:51:00,309 --> 05:51:03,339
that when you make an issue on a GitHub repository, 
当你在 Github 仓库上发起一个 issue 时

5930
05:51:03,339 --> 05:51:06,309
especially when you think there's a problem, you do want to be as in depth as possible. 
尤其是当你觉得这个问题，你希望尽可能地深入进去时

5931
05:51:06,309 --> 05:51:09,759
So oftentimes, when making an issue on these repos, 
很多时候，这些仓库被发起 issue 的时候

5932
05:51:09,759 --> 05:51:12,039
they'll even ask, what version are you using? 
他们甚至会问，你用的是哪个版本

5933
05:51:12,039 --> 05:51:15,099
Can you post all your code? 
你可以发布你完整的代码么

5934
05:51:15,099 --> 05:51:18,759
Can you post all your files and just be much, much more explicit? 
你能不能把你所有的文件都贴出来，再明确一点？

5935
05:51:18,759 --> 05:51:21,999
So how about something like this. 
那么像这样的怎么样

5936
05:51:21,999 --> 05:51:25,359
So this is going to be really good for the GitHub repo associated with this tutorial, 
像这样的就很适合放在与教程关联的 Github 仓库上

5937
05:51:25,359 --> 05:51:28,629
it looks like this person is asking about a very specific tutorial. 
这个人看起来是在问一个非常具体的教程

5938
05:51:28,629 --> 05:51:32,019
So posting this, there is going to be best. 
所以到那里发帖，是最高效的

5939

Now if your question is on a tutorial that doesn't have a GitHub repo, well, they probably should. 
如果你要询问的教程没有 Github 仓库的话，好吧，其实他们应该要有

But then maybe this is better in the comment section.

because maybe the specific error that they're running into

And finally, what about this?
