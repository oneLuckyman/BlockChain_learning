9460
09:26:10,840 --> 09:26:16,060
Now, there's a couple other tasks that are really helpful. 
现在，还有一些其它有用的任务

9461
09:26:16,060 --> 09:26:19,240
You'll see before I went ahead and just deleted artifacts and deleted the cache manually. 
你应该还记得我之前是用手动方法删除的 "artifacts" 和缓存

9462
09:26:19,240 --> 09:26:22,450
Well, to do that yourself, you can also just run yarn Hardhead, clean. 
你自己做的时候也可以运行这个 "yarn hardhat clean"

9463
09:26:22,450 --> 09:26:28,840
And that'll delete the artifacts folder and clear out your cache.
这样做就会删除 "artifacts" 文件夹并清除你的缓存

9464
09:26:28,840 --> 09:26:31,900
We already know what compiled does. 
我们已经知道 "compile" 是在干什么了

9465
09:26:31,990 --> 09:26:34,750
But one of the biggest things that Hardhead is fantastic for especially is running tests. 
但 hardhat 最大的优点之一其实是非常适合运行测试

9466
09:26:34,750 --> 09:26:37,930
Now we haven't run tests yet so far. 
目前为止我们还没有运行任何测试

9467
09:26:37,930 --> 09:26:41,920
However, running tests is absolutely critical to your smart contract development journey. 
但是，测试环节对于你的智能合约开发之旅绝对至关重要

9468
09:26:41,920 --> 09:26:45,340
And we're going to spend a lot of time in the future writing really good tests. 
未来我们将会花费大量时间来编写良好的测试

9469
09:26:45,340 --> 09:26:48,460
The reason that writing tests are so important 
之所以编写测试如此的重要

9470
09:26:48,460 --> 09:26:51,490
is because we want to make sure our code does exactly what we want it to do, 
是因为我们希望确保我们的代码确实能够实现我们想要的功能

9471
09:26:51,490 --> 09:26:55,270
especially in the defy, and the decentralized, smart contract world, 
在 DeFi 以及去中心化智能合约的世界中尤其如此

9472
09:26:55,270 --> 09:26:59,440
all of our code is going to be open source for anybody to interact with, and potentially exploit. 
我们所有的代码都将对所有人开源以供其交互，并有可能被利用

9473
09:26:59,440 --> 09:27:03,010
There's sites like req dot news, 
有一些网站比如说 "rekt.news"

9474
09:27:03,010 --> 09:27:06,400
which go through a ton of previous hacks and how they actually got hacked 
它们会介绍大量之前的黑客攻击事件还有他们是如何被攻击的

9475
09:27:06,730 --> 09:27:10,540
and what happened in the smart contract to enable these hacks to occur. 
以及智能合约中到底发生了什么才导致了这些攻击的发生

9476
09:27:10,570 --> 09:27:14,590
So testing, so writing really strong tests is always going to be our first line of defense. 
所以说编写一个强大的测试永远是我们的第一道防线

9477
09:27:14,590 --> 09:27:17,890
And we have this sample test.js, 
我们这里有一个 "sample-test.js"

9478
09:27:17,890 --> 09:27:21,760
that comes default with the basic package of hardhat. 
它是 Hardhat 默认自带的一个基础包

9479
09:27:21,760 --> 09:27:25,120
But as you probably already know, 
但你可能已经猜到了

9480
09:27:25,120 --> 09:27:28,300
we're going to rename this and change it. 
我们将把它重命名并进行修改

9481
09:27:28,300 --> 09:27:31,240
So we're going to rename this to test deploy dot j s. 
我们将把它重命名为 "test-deploy.js"

9482
09:27:31,240 --> 09:27:34,330
And we're going to delete everything in here and start from scratch. 
并删除其中的所有内容从头开始

9483
09:27:34,840 --> 09:27:39,640
We want to be able to test all of our solidity code locally, 
我们希望能够在本地测试所有的 Solidity 代码

9484
09:27:39,640 --> 09:27:43,030
so that we know exactly what it's doing. 
以便我们知道它正在做什么

9485
09:27:43,030 --> 09:27:46,630
And we can have a programmatic way to make sure that our code does what we want it to do. 
我们可以通过编程的方式来确保我们的代码会按照我们期望的方式运行

9486
09:27:46,630 --> 09:27:50,320
So let's write a basic test for our simple storage contract. 
所以让我们为我们的 "SimpleStorage" 合约写一个基本的测试

9487
09:27:50,320 --> 09:27:54,700
So that we can be sure that it's doing exactly what we want it to be doing. 
这样我们就可以确认它是否在执行我们想要的操作

9488
09:27:54,700 --> 09:27:58,870
Hard Hat testing works with the Mocha framework, 
Hardhat 测试使用的是 Mocha 框架

9489
09:27:58,870 --> 09:28:02,110
which is a JavaScript based framework for running our tests, 
它是一个基于 JavaScript 的框架用于运行我们的测试

9490
09:28:02,110 --> 09:28:06,130
you actually can write tests directly in solidity, if you'd like to, 
你甚至可以直接用 Solidity 来编写测试，如果你想的话

9491
09:28:06,130 --> 09:28:09,760
there's a bit of back and forth on whether testing with pure solidity is better or testing with a modern programming language. 
关于使用纯 Solidity 进行测试更好还是使用现代编程语言进行测试更好存在一些争议

9492
09:28:09,760 --> 09:28:13,900
The argument goes that testing with a modern programming language,
支持现代编程语言进行测试的论点是

9493
09:28:13,900 --> 09:28:16,630
you have more flexibility to do more stuff to interact and test your smart contracts. 
你会拥有更大的灵活性来对你的智能合约进行更多的交互和测试

9494
09:28:16,630 --> 09:28:19,720
But the argument for testing with us with solidity is that 
但支持使用 Solidity 进行测试的论点认为

9495
09:28:19,720 --> 09:28:22,630
we want to be as close to the code as possible. 
我们希望尽可能接近这个代码(即测试用的代码和编写智能合约用的代码相同)

9496
09:28:22,660 --> 09:28:27,010
At the time of recording, 
在录制的这个时间点

9497
09:28:27,010 --> 09:28:29,230
most projects do the vast majority of their testing in a modern programming language like JavaScript. 
大多数项目都在使用现代编程语言进行测试例如 JavaScript

9498
09:28:29,230 --> 09:28:32,200
So that's what we're going to be using here. 
所以我们这里就用这个

9499
09:28:32,200 --> 09:28:35,980
So to get started with our mocha tests, 
要想开始我们的 Mocha 测试

9500
09:28:35,980 --> 09:28:39,610
we do, we're going to write a describe function. 
我们要写一个 "describe" 函数

9501
09:28:39,640 --> 09:28:42,520
Describe is a keyword that hardheaded mocha will recognize, 
"describe" 是一个关键字，Hardhat 的 Mocha 将会识别它

9502
09:28:42,520 --> 09:28:45,610
and it takes two parameters, it takes a string, 
并且它有两个参数，第一个接收的是一个字符串

9503
09:28:45,610 --> 09:28:50,050
which we're going to just write simple storage for now. 
我们要写进去的就是 "SimpleStorage"

9504
09:28:50,050 --> 09:28:54,550
And then also takes a function, 
第二个接收的是一个函数

9505
09:28:54,550 --> 09:28:58,180
we could make function, test func and then write some stuff in here, 
我们可以创建一个函数，名为 "testFunct"，并在这里编写一些内容

9506
09:28:58,180 --> 09:29:02,500
and then pass it to our describe here. 
然后把它传递到 "describe" 这里

9507
09:29:03,400 --> 09:29:09,670
But the common convention is going to be to do is to make it as an anonymous function,
但通用的约定是让它成为一个匿名函数

9508
09:29:09,670 --> 09:29:13,930
which we can create by typing function, putting an empty parameter here, 
我们可以输入 "function"，放置一个空参数

9509
09:29:14,110 --> 09:29:17,740
and then some brackets like that. 
然后加上花括号来创建它

9510
09:29:18,250 --> 09:29:22,510
So our describe function takes a name, a string, and a function.
所以我们的 "describe" 接收一个名称字符串和一个函数

9511
09:29:22,510 --> 09:29:25,390
Another way that you'll often see functions in describe is using that anonymous function syntax. 
你经常可以在 "describe" 中见到另一种匿名函数的使用方式

9512
09:29:25,390 --> 09:29:29,560
So you might see just these parentheses, an arrow, and then some brackets, 
你可能会看到一组括号，一个箭头，然后是一些花括号

9513
09:29:29,890 --> 09:29:32,740
the two of these are going to be basically the same, 
这两种方式基本上是等价的

9514
09:29:32,740 --> 09:29:37,000
there are some differences. And this second one is actually best practice, 
区别就是，第二个在实际使用中是最好用的

9515
09:29:37,000 --> 09:29:41,440
but just know that you might see this arrow syntax in other tests as well. 
但你也要知道你可能会在其它测试中见到这种箭头语法

9516
09:29:41,440 --> 09:29:44,350
We have described a sample storage and then our function here, 
这里我们已经拥有了 "describe"，一个 "SimpleStorage" 和一个函数

9517
09:29:44,350 --> 09:29:47,830
which is going to have all of our tests in it.
这就是我们的测试所需要包含的全部内容了

9518
09:29:47,830 --> 09:29:51,280
Inside each one of our describe blocks. 
在每一个 "describe" 的代码块内

9519
09:29:51,280 --> 09:29:54,010
We're gonna have something called a before each, and a bunch of It's 
我们都会有一个 "beforeEach" 和很多 "it"

9520
09:29:54,010 --> 09:29:56,680
Our before each function is going to tell us what to do before each of our hits. 
"beforeEach" 函数会告诉我们在我们的每一个 "it" 之前要做什么

9521
09:29:56,920 --> 09:29:59,530
So we're going to have a ton of it and then we're going to have a before each. 
所以我们会有很多 "it" 而只有一个 "beforeEach"

9522
09:29:59,530 --> 09:30:03,340
All of our IDs are going to be where we actually write the code for running our tests. 
所有的 "it" 就是我们实际编写运行测试代码的地方

9523
09:30:03,340 --> 09:30:07,030
And before each is going to be some code that tells us what to do before each one of these hits,
而 "beforeEach" 则会告诉我们每个 "it" 之前需要做些什么

9524
09:30:07,060 --> 09:30:09,730
we can also actually have describes,
我们实际上还可以这么做 "describe"

9525
09:30:09,730 --> 09:30:13,030
inside of describes, which again have more before each and more before it's 
在这个 "describe" 内，又可以有更多的 "beforeEach" 和 "it"

9526
09:30:13,030 --> 09:30:15,940
having these nested describes can be really helpful for separating and modularizing our tests. 
这些嵌套的 "describe" 能很好的帮助我们分离和模块化我们的测试

9527
09:30:15,940 --> 09:30:19,270
But for this one, we're just going to have a setup that looks like this. 
但对本次测试，我们将只需要一个这样的配置

9528
09:30:19,540 --> 09:30:23,710



9529
09:30:25,540 --> 09:30:29,470
And for this demo, we're only going to have one it. 
并且在这个 demo 中我们也只有一个 "it"

9530
09:30:29,470 --> 09:30:33,550
So in order to test our smart contracts, 
为了测试我们的智能合约

9531
09:30:33,550 --> 09:30:37,780
before we actually run our tests, we're probably going to need to deploy the smart contracts first. 
在实际运行测试之前，我们可能需要先部署智能合约

9532
09:30:37,780 --> 09:30:41,080
So inside of our before each, 
因此在我们的 "beforeEach" 中

9533
09:30:41,080 --> 09:30:45,010
we're going to pass the our before each a function, 
我们将传递一个函数给我们的 "beforeEach"

9534
09:30:45,010 --> 09:30:47,710
that's going to tell our testing framework what to do before each test. 
它会告诉我们的测试框架每个测试前都要做些什么

9535
09:30:47,710 --> 09:30:50,620
So we're going to pass it an async function like this. 
所以我们要传入一个 "async function"，就像这样

9536
09:30:50,620 --> 09:30:53,470
And in here, we want to deploy our simple storage contract. 
然后在这里，我们要部署我们的 "SimpleStorage" 合约

9537
09:30:53,470 --> 09:30:56,950
So to do that, we're going to need to get the ethers framework 
为了做到这一点，我们需要获取 ethers 框架

9538
09:30:56,950 --> 09:31:00,070
and do exactly what we did in our deploy script. 
并执行我们在 "deploy" 脚本中所做的完全相同的事情

9539
09:31:00,100 --> 09:31:05,080
So in here, we're at the top we're gonna say const. 
所以这里，我们要在顶部执行 "const"

9540
09:31:05,080 --> 09:31:08,410
Ethers, equals require art have 
"{ethers} = require("hardhat")"

9541
09:31:08,410 --> 09:31:12,520
an import ethers from hard hat.
并把 ethers 从 Hardhat 中导入进来

9542
09:31:12,520 --> 09:31:15,670
Then in our before each function, 
接着在我们的 "beforeEach" 函数中

9543
09:31:16,180 --> 09:31:23,590
we'll say await ethers dot get contract factory of simple storage. 
我们将执行 "await ethers.getContractFactory("SimpleStorage")"

9544
09:31:23,830 --> 09:31:29,800
And we'll assign this to a const. Simple Storage factory. 
并将其赋给一个 "const" 变量 "simpleStorageFactory"

9545
09:31:29,800 --> 09:31:37,510
And then we'll run away, simple storage factory dot deploy. 
然后我们要运行 "await simpleStorageFactory.deploy"

9546
09:31:37,510 --> 09:31:46,240
Cool. 
OK，酷~

9547
09:31:46,960 --> 09:31:52,780
And let's also assign this to a variable cost simple. 
让我们把它也赋给一个变量 "const simpleStorage"

9548
09:31:52,810 --> 09:31:58,450
Now, since right now,


9549
09:31:58,480 --> 09:32:02,470
our simple storage and simple storage factory are scoped just


9550
09:32:02,470 --> 09:32:05,860
to inside the before each, we actually need to stick these


9551
09:32:05,860 --> 09:32:09,940
variables outside of the before each, so all of our events can


9552
09:32:09,970 --> 09:32:12,940
interact with them. So instead of having simple storage,


9553
09:32:12,940 --> 09:32:16,660
factory, and simple storage, be constant variables, we're going


9554
09:32:16,660 --> 09:32:20,140
to define them outside of them for each with the let keyword.


9555
09:32:20,350 --> 09:32:25,540
And we're gonna say let simple storage factory and we're going


9556
09:32:25,540 --> 09:32:29,860
to initialize it to nothing. And then we'll say led simple


9557
09:32:29,920 --> 09:32:32,980
storage. Now, if you have a whole bunch of let's just


9558
09:32:32,980 --> 09:32:35,380
initializing another way, you can write them in JavaScript,


9559
09:32:35,410 --> 09:32:41,080
just let simple storage factory comma, simple storage. And that


9560
09:32:41,080 --> 09:32:43,420
works exactly the same. And then we can get rid of this const


9561
09:32:43,420 --> 09:32:47,770
keyword. Because it's not a constant since we are assigning


9562
09:32:47,770 --> 09:32:50,050
it. And now we have simple storage, factory and simple


9563
09:32:50,050 --> 09:32:53,200
storage that we can use inside of our init function. Now we


9564
09:32:53,200 --> 09:32:56,140
have a before each section. So before each one of our tests,


9565
09:32:56,200 --> 09:32:58,630
we're going to deploy our simple storage contract. So we have a


9566
09:32:58,630 --> 09:33:02,200
brand new contract to interact with for each one of our tests.


9567
09:33:02,260 --> 09:33:05,920
Now, inside of the ID, this is where we're going to say what we


9568
09:33:05,920 --> 09:33:09,310
want this specific test to do, and then describe the code


9569
09:33:09,550 --> 09:33:13,480
that's going to actually do that. So we're going to say it


9570
09:33:13,870 --> 09:33:20,980
should start with a favorite number of zero. So this is


9571
09:33:20,980 --> 09:33:24,190
saying what this test should do. And then we're going to add our


9572
09:33:24,220 --> 09:33:27,910
async function to actually do that. So we'll say async


9573
09:33:28,720 --> 09:33:34,060
function. And in here, this is where we'll actually write the


9574
09:33:34,060 --> 09:33:38,020
code to make sure that our contract does exactly this.


9575
09:33:38,080 --> 09:33:45,640
We're say const. Current Value, equals await, simple storage.re


9576
09:33:46,840 --> 09:33:50,440
retrieve. And now in this test, we want to say okay, now check


9577
09:33:50,440 --> 09:33:54,100
to see that this current value is indeed zero. So how do we do


9578
09:33:54,100 --> 09:33:59,200
that? Well, we can say const, expected value is going to equal


9579
09:33:59,830 --> 09:34:04,360
zero. And what we can do is we can do either we can use either


9580
09:34:04,360 --> 09:34:08,170
the assert keyword, or the expect keyword, which we're


9581
09:34:08,170 --> 09:34:12,970
going to import both of these from a package called Chai. We


9582
09:34:12,970 --> 09:34:16,420
actually installed Chai automatically when we downloaded


9583
09:34:16,420 --> 09:34:19,120
the basic parameters when we downloaded the basic packages


9584
09:34:19,120 --> 09:34:23,050
for hardhats. So at the top, we're gonna say const. Expect


9585
09:34:23,260 --> 09:34:24,310
and assert


9586
09:34:25,630 --> 09:34:30,760
equals require Chai, I'm a big fan of using assert as much as


9587
09:34:30,760 --> 09:34:33,160
possible, because I think the syntax makes a little bit more


9588
09:34:33,190 --> 09:34:36,010
sense. But there will be scenarios where we need to use


9589
09:34:36,010 --> 09:34:39,130
expect instead. Now, assert has a ton of functions that are


9590
09:34:39,130 --> 09:34:43,030
built in that help us make sure this is what we expect it to be.


9591
09:34:43,060 --> 09:34:48,040
So I can do assert dot equal current value.to string, because


9592
09:34:48,040 --> 09:34:51,130
remember, this is actually going to be a big number, comma,


9593
09:34:51,370 --> 09:34:55,480
expected value. So I'm saying I'm asserting this retrieve to


9594
09:34:55,480 --> 09:34:59,440
return zero, which is going to be our expected value. Now to


9595
09:34:59,440 --> 09:35:04,570
actually run this, we're going to run yarn, art hat test. And


9596
09:35:04,570 --> 09:35:07,840
we see we get an output that looks like this should start


9597
09:35:07,840 --> 09:35:10,870
with favorite number of zero, and it's indeed passing. You'll


9598
09:35:10,870 --> 09:35:14,620
notice that if I were to change this to one, and this wasn't


9599
09:35:14,620 --> 09:35:18,220
correct, it would break and it would say art Pass or not


9600
09:35:18,220 --> 09:35:23,890
passing assertion error expected zero to equal one. It expected


9601
09:35:23,920 --> 09:35:29,260
zero to equal one, which is not what we want. We want zero to


9602
09:35:29,260 --> 09:35:33,430
equal zero. So let's run this again. Tada should start with


9603
09:35:33,430 --> 09:35:36,640
favorite number zero, and it's passing. Alright, fantastic. So


9604
09:35:36,640 --> 09:35:40,030
that's how we wrote one of our tests, let's write one more test


9605
09:35:40,060 --> 09:35:43,060
just to make sure that things are good. So let's say it should


9606
09:35:43,060 --> 09:35:48,490
update when we call store, because when we call the store


9607
09:35:48,490 --> 09:35:51,850
function, we want our favorite number to update. And we'll make


9608
09:35:51,850 --> 09:35:56,560
this an async function as well. And let's add our stuff in here.


9609
09:35:56,770 --> 09:36:01,360
So we'll say const. Expected Value equals seven, we're


9610
09:36:01,360 --> 09:36:04,990
expecting that when we call store it updates to seven. Now


9611
09:36:05,020 --> 09:36:11,620
we can say const. Transaction response equals await simple


9612
09:36:11,620 --> 09:36:16,840
storage dot store. And we can even just pass it the expected


9613
09:36:16,840 --> 09:36:21,670
value here. And then we'll do a weight transaction response that


9614
09:36:21,670 --> 09:36:25,240
weight one. Now let's get the current value. So we'll say


9615
09:36:25,240 --> 09:36:31,030
const. Current Value equals weight, simple storage,


9616
09:36:32,080 --> 09:36:37,750
retrieve. And now we're going to assert dot equal current


9617
09:36:37,750 --> 09:36:44,140
value.to string, comma expected value. And now we can run all


9618
09:36:44,140 --> 09:36:47,440
these tests by running yarn Hardhead test. And you'll see we


9619
09:36:47,440 --> 09:36:51,700
ran both of these tests. And now if I have 10,000 tests, and I'm


9620
09:36:51,700 --> 09:36:55,000
only finagling with one test, I can actually just run one test


9621
09:36:55,000 --> 09:37:01,570
by running yarn, art app, test, dash dash grep. And I can search


9622
09:37:01,600 --> 09:37:06,160
for any keywords in any of the text here. So I'm going to grep


9623
09:37:06,160 --> 09:37:10,660
for the store function. Because the store keyword isn't in this


9624
09:37:10,660 --> 09:37:14,740
tax for this, it, it's only in the text for this it. So if I do


9625
09:37:14,740 --> 09:37:18,550
grep store, it should only run our second test, which does


9626
09:37:18,550 --> 09:37:22,840
indeed, one other way we can run only specific tests is with the


9627
09:37:22,840 --> 09:37:28,030
only keyword. So we can type it dot only like that. And then we


9628
09:37:28,030 --> 09:37:33,430
can run yarn, art hat test. And it should only run, this should


9629
09:37:33,490 --> 09:37:36,820
update when we call store. And it does indeed, then we'll go


9630
09:37:36,820 --> 09:37:40,750
ahead and delete this save, run again, and it should run all


9631
09:37:40,750 --> 09:37:45,250
too. Fantastic. Now the other way you'll see these tests


9632
09:37:45,250 --> 09:37:49,210
written is with instead of assert, it'll use the expect


9633
09:37:49,210 --> 09:37:52,600
keyword. So you'll see something like expect current


9634
09:37:52,600 --> 09:37:59,260
value.to string.to dot equal expected value, the two of these


9635
09:37:59,290 --> 09:38:03,520
lines do exactly the same thing. And it's sort of up to you on


9636
09:38:03,520 --> 09:38:06,160
which one you want to use. And that's all we're going to do for


9637
09:38:06,160 --> 09:38:12,280
our testing. Now. This is fantastic, great job.
