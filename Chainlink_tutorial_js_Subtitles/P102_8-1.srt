12388
12:33:00,250 --> 12:33:03,610
Alright, awesome. You've just completed Lesson Seven, the heart had fun me. 
非常好，你已经完成了 "Lesson 7: Hardhat Fund Me"

12389
12:33:03,610 --> 12:33:07,210
And now it's time to move on to lesson eight,
现在是时候移步到 Lesson 8 了

12390
12:33:07,210 --> 12:33:11,080
which is going to be our HTML slash JavaScript to fund me, 
标题是 "HTML/JavaScript Fund Me"

12391
12:33:11,080 --> 12:33:13,360
you can find all the code for what we're about to go through, of course, on my GitHub repo. 
你可以在我的 GitHub 仓库中找到所有代码

12392
12:33:13,360 --> 12:33:16,810
And for this section, we're now going to start to see some of the differences between Node js between that back end JavaScript, 
在这一节中，我们会看到 Node.js 和后端 JavaScript 

12393
12:33:16,810 --> 12:33:20,050
and JavaScript in the browser or front end JavaScript. 
以及浏览器中的 JavaScript 或者说前端 JavaScript 之间的区别

12394
12:33:20,050 --> 12:33:23,080
And if you come to the GitHub repo associated with this lesson, 
如果你来到与这节课关联的 GitHub 仓库

12395
12:33:23,080 --> 12:33:25,540
our main version we'll be using what's considered better front end JavaScript. 
我们 main 版本使用的是通常被认为更好的 JavaScript 前端版本

12396
12:33:25,540 --> 12:33:28,900
But we'll also have a no JS addition, as well, 
但我们同样会提供一个 Node.js 版本

12397
12:33:28,900 --> 12:33:32,710
if some of the front end JavaScript is really confusing, 
如果某些 JavaScript 前端确实令人困惑的话

12398
12:33:32,710 --> 12:33:36,010
and you'll see what I mean with some of those differences very soon. 
很快你就会看到我所说的区别是什么意思

12399
12:33:36,010 --> 12:33:38,650
Now, people can programmatically interact with our smart contracts at any time. 
现在，人们可以随时通过编程的方式与智能合约进行交互

12400
12:33:38,650 --> 12:33:41,680
However, most of our users are not compete developers. 
然而，大多数用户并不完全是开发者

12401
12:33:41,680 --> 12:33:43,600
So we need to create a website, 
所以我们需要创建一个网站

12402
12:33:43,600 --> 12:33:47,170
we need to create a user interface 
创建一个用户界面(User Interface)

12403
12:33:47,170 --> 12:33:49,900
for them to interact with our smart contracts and interact with our protocols. 
让他们能使用我们的协议与我们的智能合约进行交互

12404
12:33:49,900 --> 12:33:52,690
And that's what this section is going to teach us, 
这就是本节课要教授的内容

12405
12:33:52,690 --> 12:33:55,090
it's going to be an introduction to building these fullstack. 
即构建全栈应用的介绍

12406
12:33:55,090 --> 12:33:57,550
building these front ends on top of our smart contracts. 
在我们的智能合约之上构建这些前端应用

12407
12:33:57,790 --> 12:34:00,490
Now, I wanted to show you what this is actually going to look like when we finish it. 
现在我要给你展示的是实际完成后的效果是什么样的

12408
12:34:00,490 --> 12:34:03,100
Because here, we're actually going to make our first front end our first website using the blockchain using web three. 
我们要做的是使用区块链和 Web3 来创建我们的首个前端，首个网站

12409
12:34:03,100 --> 12:34:06,130
And it's going to be an incredibly minimalistic website. 
这会是一个非常简约的网站

12410
12:34:06,130 --> 12:34:09,130
As you can see right here, 
正如你现在所看到的

12411
12:34:09,130 --> 12:34:12,820
we're not going to have any styling, 
我们不会做任何风格化处理

12412
12:34:12,820 --> 12:34:16,000
we're just going to show you how to get the functionality. 
只向你展示如何获取这些功能

12413
12:34:16,000 --> 12:34:18,400
And additionally, we're going to do a couple of things that aren't really recommended and are definitely not best practices. 
此外，我们要做几件既不推荐也非最优的事

12414
12:34:18,400 --> 12:34:21,580
The reason we're going to do it like this is the same reason that in math class, 
我们之所以这么做，原因就和在数学课上一样

12415
12:34:21,610 --> 12:34:23,920
before you learn the tricks for derivatives, 
在你学习关于求导数的各种技巧之前

12416
12:34:23,920 --> 12:34:27,100
you learn what a derivative actually is. 
你得先了解导数是什么

12417
12:34:27,100 --> 12:34:29,350
We're teaching it like this first, 
我们先这样教你

12418
12:34:29,350 --> 12:34:31,390
so that you can understand 
这样你就能理解

12419
12:34:31,390 --> 12:34:34,270
what's going on on the websites when you interact with them. And when you work with them. 
当你与网站进行交互和工作的时候它发生了些什么

12420
12:34:34,270 --> 12:34:37,090
We saw already with Foston, touching the link 
我们之前来看过 "faucets.chain.link"

12421
12:34:37,090 --> 12:34:39,790
where we can connect our wallets and we can work with the faucets. 
我们可以在这里连接到我们的钱包并使用水龙头

12422
12:34:39,790 --> 12:34:42,730
All decentralized applications have this website and have this setup where you connect your wallet 
所有的去中心化应用都会有这样的网站和设置供你连接钱包

12423
12:34:42,730 --> 12:34:45,310
and then you interact by clicking buttons, 
接着你可以通过这些按钮进行交互

12424
12:34:45,490 --> 12:34:48,250
which make these function calls to the blockchain. 
以在区块链上调用这些函数

12425
12:34:48,280 --> 12:34:50,980



12426
12:34:50,980 --> 12:34:53,560



12427
12:34:53,560 --> 12:34:56,470
And here's going to be our minimalistic website that


12428
12:34:56,470 --> 12:34:59,410
does exactly that. So this section is just going to teach


12429
12:34:59,410 --> 12:35:01,750
you what's going on under the hood. So you can really


12430
12:35:01,780 --> 12:35:04,930
understand how to build these applications at a professional


12431
12:35:04,930 --> 12:35:07,900
level. So for this section, if you don't want to code along


12432
12:35:07,900 --> 12:35:10,780
with me, you definitely don't have to however, coding along


12433
12:35:10,780 --> 12:35:13,600
with me will definitely ingrain everything in your memory here.


12434
12:35:13,630 --> 12:35:17,320
So here's what an application is going to look like. We have our


12435
12:35:17,320 --> 12:35:20,680
website here, which is connected to our hard hat, our local


12436
12:35:20,680 --> 12:35:24,460
blockchain, but it's gonna run exactly the same as if it was on


12437
12:35:24,460 --> 12:35:27,580
a real test net, the first thing you'll notice is in our meta


12438
12:35:27,580 --> 12:35:31,330
mask, we are not connected. And we'll go ahead and hit Connect,


12439
12:35:31,360 --> 12:35:34,420
and meta masks will pop up asking us if we want to connect,


12440
12:35:34,540 --> 12:35:38,260
we'll go ahead and connect to it. And now we'll be able to


12441
12:35:38,260 --> 12:35:40,750
interact with our heart at Funmi. You'll notice two buttons


12442
12:35:40,750 --> 12:35:43,030
here are functions that we're familiar with, we have our


12443
12:35:43,030 --> 12:35:45,310
withdrawal function, which is going to be our withdrawal


12444
12:35:45,310 --> 12:35:48,340
function that we just created. And then of course, we also have


12445
12:35:48,370 --> 12:35:52,330
our fund function here where we push or we send Aetherium or


12446
12:35:52,540 --> 12:35:56,140
Matic or whatever, native blockchain token to our smart


12447
12:35:56,140 --> 12:35:58,630
contract. So we can do it through this user interface. So


12448
12:35:58,630 --> 12:36:01,180
once we're connected, if we want to see the balance, we can


12449
12:36:01,180 --> 12:36:04,660
actually right click, hit Inspect, come over to our


12450
12:36:04,660 --> 12:36:08,500
console. And we'll print out to the JavaScript console, the


12451
12:36:08,500 --> 12:36:12,040
current balance of our smart contract. So nobody has funded


12452
12:36:12,040 --> 12:36:15,130
this yet, we can come down, we can choose an amount we want to


12453
12:36:15,130 --> 12:36:19,210
fund. So for example, maybe 0.1, eath, we'll go ahead, we'll hit


12454
12:36:19,210 --> 12:36:22,300
fund, meta masks will pop up, we'll get a little council


12455
12:36:22,300 --> 12:36:25,720
saying funding with 0.1. And it'll give us all the


12456
12:36:25,720 --> 12:36:30,190
transaction details that we need to send 0.1 eath, to our smart


12457
12:36:30,190 --> 12:36:33,580
contract, we can go ahead and hit Confirm. And after it's been


12458
12:36:33,580 --> 12:36:36,910
confirmed after it's been mined on our local blockchain, we had


12459
12:36:36,910 --> 12:36:41,260
get balance, we now see that it's 0.1. We could call fund


12460
12:36:41,260 --> 12:36:44,050
again, we could have multiple funders, we could switch between


12461
12:36:44,050 --> 12:36:46,690
different accounts and fund with different amounts. And we can


12462
12:36:46,690 --> 12:36:49,480
see that funding amount increase, then we can call the


12463
12:36:49,480 --> 12:36:52,510
withdrawal function. As long as we're the owner, we can confirm


12464
12:36:52,540 --> 12:36:54,490
and we can pull out all the money out of our funding


12465
12:36:54,490 --> 12:36:57,370
contract. And we'll get balance. Now we'll see the balance is


12466
12:36:57,370 --> 12:37:00,370
reset to zero. So this is what we're going to be building. Are


12467
12:37:00,370 --> 12:37:01,930
you ready? I sure am.


12468
12:37:01,960 --> 12:37:04,810
Let's get into it. This is the introduction to building


12469
12:37:04,810 --> 12:37:07,810
websites with web three. All the information here is available in


12470
12:37:07,810 --> 12:37:10,840
our GitHub repo, so feel free to follow along there. Alright, so


12471
12:37:10,840 --> 12:37:14,440
if you're in your heart head Funmi dash Free Code Camp repo,


12472
12:37:14,470 --> 12:37:17,080
we're still going to want to have this open as well. But


12473
12:37:17,080 --> 12:37:20,290
we're also going to want to create a new Visual Studio code


12474
12:37:20,320 --> 12:37:24,490
for working with our new repo. So let's go ahead and CD down a


12475
12:37:24,490 --> 12:37:31,630
directory. We'll type MK dir, we'll call this HTML, Fund Me


12476
12:37:32,050 --> 12:37:36,460
Free Code Camp. We'll cd into that. And we'll open this up by


12477
12:37:36,460 --> 12:37:40,870
typing code period. You can also do File Open Folder, but we just


12478
12:37:40,870 --> 12:37:45,460
want to open this up in a new Visual Studio Code. New VS code


12479
12:37:45,460 --> 12:37:49,450
will pop up but before we flip over to that, we do want to CD


12480
12:37:49,450 --> 12:37:54,550
down CD back into hard hat fun we Free Code Camp because we are


12481
12:37:54,550 --> 12:37:57,130
still going to use everything in here. We're still going to


12482
12:37:57,130 --> 12:38:01,120
deploy In a smart contract using this folder and using this repo,


12483
12:38:01,180 --> 12:38:04,120
when you're building daps, or websites that are connected to


12484
12:38:04,120 --> 12:38:08,140
the blockchain, you'll usually have two repositories or repos.


12485
12:38:08,470 --> 12:38:10,990
One is going to be for the smart contracts, like what we see


12486
12:38:10,990 --> 12:38:13,690
here. This is our repo that has all the code for our smart


12487
12:38:13,690 --> 12:38:16,480
contracts. And then you'll also have one for the front end slash


12488
12:38:16,480 --> 12:38:18,880
website. And it's going to be the combination of these two


12489
12:38:18,880 --> 12:38:22,120
repos, which makes up the full stack. So when people are


12490
12:38:22,120 --> 12:38:25,360
talking about full stack, they're talking about the smart


12491
12:38:25,360 --> 12:38:31,150
contracts, which is going to be our back end, plus, plus our


12492
12:38:31,150 --> 12:38:36,010
HTML slash JavaScript slash website stuff, which is going to


12493
12:38:36,010 --> 12:38:39,910
be our front end. So smart contracts are the back end, HTML


12494
12:38:39,910 --> 12:38:42,610
slash JavaScript slash website stuff is going to be our front


12495
12:38:42,610 --> 12:38:45,640
end. So we have our back end already. And now we're going to


12496
12:38:45,640 --> 12:38:48,040
build our front end, we want to keep this up because we're going


12497
12:38:48,040 --> 12:38:51,940
to need it to test and interact with our front end. Awesome. So


12498
12:38:52,150 --> 12:38:56,650
we have this new folder now, HTML Funmi, Free Code Camp. Now


12499
12:38:56,650 --> 12:38:59,860
this course is not a how to learn front end course, we are


12500
12:38:59,860 --> 12:39:02,980
going to teach you a number of front end concepts. But if you


12501
12:39:02,980 --> 12:39:06,670
want to learn a full traditional front end course, once again,


12502
12:39:06,670 --> 12:39:08,920
you can check out Free Code Camp, they've got a ton of


12503
12:39:08,920 --> 12:39:11,710
fantastic tutorials, I'm teaching you front end, if you


12504
12:39:11,710 --> 12:39:13,720
go ahead and follow along with me, though, you'll definitely


12505
12:39:13,720 --> 12:39:17,200
get a basic understanding of front end as well as front ends


12506
12:39:17,200 --> 12:39:19,690
and how it relates to our smart contracts. Additionally, you


12507
12:39:19,690 --> 12:39:22,450
don't have to do the front end parts or the full stack parts.


12508
12:39:22,480 --> 12:39:25,900
If you only want to take this course, to learn back end and to


12509
12:39:25,900 --> 12:39:28,990
learn JavaScript, and to learn solidity and learn how to do


12510
12:39:28,990 --> 12:39:31,150
these smart contracts programmatically, then you can


12511
12:39:31,180 --> 12:39:34,210
absolutely skip these front end parts. However, if you want to


12512
12:39:34,210 --> 12:39:36,640
learn to build exciting websites, and you want to have


12513
12:39:36,670 --> 12:39:39,160
other people other than developers interact with your


12514
12:39:39,160 --> 12:39:41,800
protocols, you definitely want to watch this part. Now before


12515
12:39:41,800 --> 12:39:44,590
we actually jump in here and start writing our code. We need


12516
12:39:44,590 --> 12:39:48,880
to understand what exactly is going on when work with one of


12517
12:39:48,880 --> 12:39:51,910
these websites that use the blockchain. So I actually made a


12518
12:39:51,910 --> 12:39:55,030
video about this recently. So let's watch a segment from that


12519
12:39:55,030 --> 12:39:57,430
really quick, just so that we can get up to speed with with


12520
12:39:57,430 --> 12:40:00,520
exactly what's going on behind the scenes of these websites


12521
12:40:00,730 --> 12:40:06,040
that interact with the blockchain.
