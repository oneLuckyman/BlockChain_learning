10842
10:52:48,530 --> 10:52:54,500
So we are going to show us doing this on a test net on Rinkeby. 
现在我们要展示如何在

10843
10:52:54,500 --> 10:52:57,740
But before we actually test it on Rinkeby, 


10844
10:52:57,740 --> 10:53:00,530
I'm going to add a little bit of the auto verification piece in here as well, 


10845
10:53:00,530 --> 10:53:03,440
because we did that in the last lesson. 


10846
10:53:03,440 --> 10:53:06,290
And we wanted to show how to do it in hard hat deploy as well. 


10847
10:53:06,290 --> 10:53:09,770
So right after we deploy our Funmi, we can do something similar here, 


10848
10:53:09,770 --> 10:53:13,100
we'll say, if developer chains includes network dot name, 


10849
10:53:13,100 --> 10:53:17,150
we'll say if developer chains doesn't include network dot name, 


10850
10:53:17,150 --> 10:53:19,670
because we don't want to verify on a local network. 


10851
10:53:19,700 --> 10:53:25,010
So we'll say if not development chains dot includes network dot name, 


10852
10:53:25,010 --> 10:53:28,670
the exclamation mark, aka the bang 


10853
10:53:29,000 --> 10:53:32,690
means not when we're talking about booleans. 


10854
10:53:32,960 --> 10:53:36,080
So we're saying, if the name of the network isn't a development chain, 


10855
10:53:36,080 --> 10:53:41,450
we want to go ahead and verify and same as last time. 


10856
10:53:41,450 --> 10:53:45,170
And if process dot e NV dot ether scan API key,


10857
10:53:46,490 --> 10:53:50,270
then we're going to go ahead and verify. 


10858
10:53:50,270 --> 10:53:53,450
Now before we had our verify code, right in our deploy code, 


10859
10:53:53,450 --> 10:53:56,450
we're gonna do something a little bit different here. 


10860
10:53:56,450 --> 10:53:59,810
Instead of having our verify code in our deploy scripts here, 


10861
10:53:59,810 --> 10:54:04,250
we're actually going to create a new folder called utils, which stands for utilities. 


10862
10:54:04,250 --> 10:54:07,010
And this is where we're going to add different scripts that 


10863
10:54:07,010 --> 10:54:09,200
we can use across different deployments. 


10864
10:54:09,200 --> 10:54:12,320
Because let's say we have 50 Deploy scripts, 


10865
10:54:12,320 --> 10:54:15,350
we're not going to make 50 Deploy functions, 


10866
10:54:15,470 --> 10:54:19,460
we're just going to add them to our utils folder, 


10867
10:54:19,580 --> 10:54:23,270
and in our utils folder, or create a new file called verify dot j s, 


10868
10:54:23,270 --> 10:54:26,540
we're going to add that code from our last project in here. 


10869
10:54:26,540 --> 10:54:30,200
So if you want, you can go ahead copy paste from our last project over to this one, 


10870
10:54:30,200 --> 10:54:33,320
or you can pause the video to type it out yourself. 


10871
10:54:33,320 --> 10:54:38,810
Since we're using the run command here, we're gonna do const run equals require RT hat. 


10872
10:54:38,810 --> 10:54:47,750
And then at the bottom, we're going to do module exports. Exports equals verify.


10873
10:54:48,470 --> 10:54:53,180
Now that we have a verify script in our utils folder, 


10874
10:54:53,180 --> 10:54:59,090
back in our deploy Funmi we're going to say 


10875
10:54:59,090 --> 10:55:04,970
const. Verify equals require dot dot slash utils. Slash verify. 


10876
10:55:05,000 --> 10:55:08,540
And since now in our verified Jas, we have a lot of this trycatch stuff in here, 


10877
10:55:08,540 --> 10:55:15,140
we can just do a wait. Verify 


10878
10:55:15,140 --> 10:55:18,320
and a verify once again takes a contract address and a list of arguments. 


10879
10:55:18,350 --> 10:55:24,680
We'll say await verify, fund me dot address and then the list of arguments. 


10880
10:55:24,680 --> 10:55:27,740
To make the list of arguments easier to put in. 


10881
10:55:27,740 --> 10:55:32,540
You can go const args, equals and then we'll just stick our eth USD price feed in here 


10882
10:55:32,540 --> 10:55:37,640
and then replace this with args 


10883
10:55:37,640 --> 10:55:42,410
and then take this args and pop it on down into the second parameter here. 


10884
10:55:42,410 --> 10:55:48,560
All right, great.
