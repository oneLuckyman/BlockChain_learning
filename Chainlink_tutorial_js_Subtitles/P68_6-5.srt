8776
08:41:40,539 --> 08:41:47,769
Hardhead has this fantastic tool built in called The Hard Hat Network 
Hardhat 内置了一个很棒的工具叫做 "Hardhat Network"

8777
08:41:47,769 --> 08:41:51,639
hard hat comes built in with Hard Hat Network, 
Hardhat 内置 Hardhat Network

8778
08:41:51,639 --> 08:41:54,819
a local Aetherium network node designed for development, 
它是一个专为开发而设计的本地以太坊网络节点

8779
08:41:54,819 --> 08:41:58,149
akin to ganache, that allows you to deploy your contracts and run your tests and debug your code.
与 Ganache 相似，它允许你部署合约，运行测试以及调试代码

8780
08:41:58,149 --> 08:42:00,789
Whenever we run a command in hard hat, or a script and hard hat or a task and hard hat, 
每当我们在 Hardhat 中运行命令、脚本或者任务时

8781
08:42:00,879 --> 08:42:04,839
we by default deploy to this fake Hard Hat Network. 
我们都是默认部署到这个虚拟的 Hardhat Network

8782
08:42:04,839 --> 08:42:08,349
This Hard Hat Network is very similar to ganache, 
这个 Hardhat Network 与 Ganache 十分相似

8783
08:42:08,379 --> 08:42:11,439
except for instead of having this UI, 
除了没有这个 UI 界面

8784
08:42:11,469 --> 08:42:15,039
it runs in the background for our scripts. 
它在我们脚本的后台中运行

8785
08:42:15,039 --> 08:42:18,549
In fact, if we go to our hard hat.config.js, 
事实上，如果我们打开 "hardhat.config.js" 

8786
08:42:18,549 --> 08:42:22,509
we can scroll down to the bottom to this module that exports section 
我们可以滑倒底部找到这个 "module.exports" 部分

8787
08:42:22,509 --> 08:42:26,409
and add more information about our default networks. 
并添加有关默认网络的更多信息

8788
08:42:26,409 --> 08:42:29,709
So right now, if we don't have anything in this module that export, 
现在，如果我们在 "module.exports" 中没有任何相关信息

8789
08:42:29,709 --> 08:42:32,739
by default, it adds this piece called default network hardhat. 
那么默认情况下，它就会添加 "defaultNetwork: 'hardhat'"

8790
08:42:32,739 --> 08:42:39,129
So anytime we run a script,
所以无论我们什么时候运行脚本

8791
08:42:39,249 --> 08:42:42,459
without specifying a network, it automatically uses this fake Hard Hat Network. 
只要没有特别指定某个网络，它都会自动使用这个虚拟的 Hardhat Network

8792
08:42:42,459 --> 08:42:45,399
And this fake Hard Hat Network 
并且这个虚拟的 Hardhat Network

8793
08:42:45,429 --> 08:42:49,509
comes automatically with an RPC URL and a private key for you. 
会自动为你提供一个 "RPC URL" 和一个私钥

8794
08:42:49,509 --> 08:42:52,959
So you don't even have to add one in. 
所以你不必再额外添加一个了

8795
08:42:52,959 --> 08:42:56,049
This is one of the major advantages of working with Hardhead. 
这是使用 Hardhat 工作的主要优势之一

8796
08:42:56,049 --> 08:42:59,829
It just automatically gives you this fake blockchain. And these fake private keys, 
它会自动为你提供一个虚拟区块链以及虚拟私钥

8797
08:42:59,829 --> 08:43:02,349
if you want to be a little bit more explicit. And I always recommend being more explicit, 
如果你想让这里更明确一些，并且我也认为明确一点会比较好

8798
08:43:02,349 --> 08:43:06,369
we can add the default network in to the module that are experts. 
那么可以在 "module.exports" 中添加一下 "defaultNetwork" 

8799
08:43:06,369 --> 08:43:09,909
So now our default network is explicitly stated as hard hat. 
所以现在我们的 "defaultNetwork" 被明确指定为 "hardhat"

8800
08:43:09,939 --> 08:43:13,569
However, in any script, you run,
不过，无论任何脚本，你都可以在运行时

8801
08:43:13,599 --> 08:43:16,629
you can choose whatever network you want to work with. 
选择你想要使用的任意网络

8802
08:43:16,629 --> 08:43:20,349
So if I want to explicitly say 
所以如果我想明确指定

8803
08:43:20,349 --> 08:43:25,479
I want to run our deploy script on our fake Hard Hat Network, 
我想在虚拟的 Hardhat Network 上运行我们的部署脚本的话

8804
08:43:25,899 --> 08:43:31,689
I can do yarn, hard hat, run scripts, deploy dot j s, dash dash network, hard hat, 
我可以这么做 "yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat"

8805
08:43:31,689 --> 08:43:34,719
this is us telling her that, 
这就是我们在告诉 Hardhat

8806
08:43:34,719 --> 08:43:37,119
hey, we want to run this script on the Hard Hat Network. 
嘿，我们要在 Hardhat Network 上运行这个脚本

8807
08:43:37,119 --> 08:43:41,289
Hopefully, you might be able to see where this is going. 
希望你已经看明白这是怎么一回事了

8808
08:43:41,289 --> 08:43:44,469
Having this network flag 
有了这个网络标识之后

8809
08:43:44,469 --> 08:43:48,039
makes it incredibly easy to switch across different chains, different block chains, different private keys, etc. 
在不同链，不同区块链，不同私钥等等之间的切换就会变得非常容易

8810
08:43:48,039 --> 08:43:51,489
So we have our default network set the hard hat here, 
现在我们把这里的 defaultNetwork 设置为了 hardhat

8811
08:43:51,489 --> 08:43:56,349
we can add other networks in here as well. 
我们也可以在这里添加其它网络

8812
08:43:56,379 --> 08:43:58,659
The way we do that is we're going to add a networks section. 
方法就是添加一个 "network" 部分

8813
08:43:58,659 --> 08:44:01,539
And we're going to define any of the network sections that we want. 
并按照我们的需要定义它

8814
08:44:01,539 --> 08:44:04,269
And remember to put a comment there so that your Visual Studio code doesn't get mad at you. 
记得这里要加个逗号，这样你的 Visual Studio Code 就不会向你报错了

8815
08:44:04,269 --> 08:44:08,829
So recently, we worked with Rigby so let's go ahead and add a Rinkeby network in here. 
就近期来说，我们使用的是 Rinkeby，所以我们来添加一个 Rinkeby 网络

8816
08:44:08,829 --> 08:44:12,159
So we're gonna say another network is gonna be really 
所以我要指定另外的网络是 "rinkeby"

8817
08:44:12,489 --> 08:44:16,119
cool. So I should just be able to change the network flag to Rigby now, right? 
酷！所以我现在应该能够切换网络标识为 Rinkeby 了，对吧？

8818
08:44:16,119 --> 08:44:24,429
Well, not quite. 
好吧，并不是

8819
08:44:24,699 --> 08:44:28,179
If you try to run that, 
如果你尝试运行，

8820
08:44:28,239 --> 08:44:32,259
you're gonna get invalid value undefined for hardhat config networks. Rigby, that URL, 
就会得到 “无效的未定义值 HardhatConfig.networks.rinkeby.url”

8821
08:44:32,289 --> 08:44:35,619
it's expecting you to tell it, hey, what the URL is, 
它希望你能告诉它，嘿，这是什么 URL

8822
08:44:35,619 --> 08:44:38,619
since this isn't the hard hat network, 
因为这并不是 Hardhat Network

8823
08:44:38,619 --> 08:44:41,739
we need to tell hard hat exactly how we're going to connect to rink B. 
所以我们需要告诉 hardhat 如何链接到 Rinkeby

8824
08:44:41,739 --> 08:44:44,439
And this is where a lot of what we learned before is going to come in handy, again, 
这就是我们之前学到的许多知识再次派上用场的地方了

8825
08:44:44,439 --> 08:44:48,279
exactly the same as what we did before. 
就和我们之前做的完全一样

8826
08:44:48,279 --> 08:44:52,749
We're going to create a new Dotty v file, and we're going to add our Rigby URL in this dot env file. 
我们要创建一个新的 ".env" 文件，并在其中添加 "rinkeby URL"

8827
08:44:52,749 --> 08:44:56,199
Just remember, dot env is an r dot get ignore just in case. 
记住 ".env" 要放到 ".gitignore" 里以防万一

8828
08:44:56,199 --> 08:44:59,979
So in our Dotty env, we're going to add that RPC URL from alcmi back in here 
所以在 ".env" 里，我们要从 alchemy 添加相应的 "RPC URL" 

8829
08:44:59,979 --> 08:45:04,449
before we just said RPC URL. But since we might want to work across multiple networks, 
在指定 "RPC URL" 之前，由于我们可能要在多个网络上工作

8830
08:45:04,449 --> 08:45:07,359
it's usually good to specify exactly what network each URL stands for. 
所以通常最好是确切指定每个 URL 对应的具体网络

8831
08:45:07,389 --> 08:45:11,409
So we're gonna say Rynkeby RPC URL equals and then paste that URL in here. 
所以我们要输入 "RINKEBY_RPC_URL = " 然后把 URL 粘贴到这里

8832
08:45:12,249 --> 08:45:18,699
Now, as you probably have guessed, 
现在，你可能已经猜到了

8833
08:45:18,699 --> 08:45:22,059
we can add our URL to our Rinkeby network here. 
我们要把 URL 添加给这里的 rinkeby 网络

8834
08:45:22,059 --> 08:45:25,719
for readability, I usually like to add them as variables right above the module that experts. 
为了可读性，我通常喜欢把它们添加为变量，放到 "module.exports" 上方

8835
08:45:25,719 --> 08:45:29,679
So I'll say const Rynkeby. RPC URL equals process dot E and V dot Rynkeby RPC URL.
所以就是 "const RINKEBY_RPC_URL = process.env.RINKEBY_RPC_URL"

8836
08:45:29,979 --> 08:45:40,269
And once again, we're going to be pulling that Rinckey RPC URL from our environment variable. 
再次提醒一下，我们将从环境变量中获取 "RINKEBY_RPC_URL"

8837
08:45:40,719 --> 08:45:43,869
Of course, in order to pull that environment variable in, 
当然，为了获取这个环境变量

8838
08:45:44,079 --> 08:45:47,679
we're going to need to use that dot env package again. 
我们需要再次调用那个 "dotenv" 包

8839
08:45:47,679 --> 08:45:50,709
So to add that in, we're going to yarn add dash dash dev dot EMV. 
要想添加它，我们要做的就是 "yarn add --dev dotenv"

8840
08:45:50,709 --> 08:45:54,789
And at the top of our Hardhead config, 
然后在 "hardhat.config.js" 的顶部


8841
08:45:54,789 --> 08:46:00,609
we're going to add require dot EMV, 
我们要添加 "require("dotenv")"

8842
08:46:00,909 --> 08:46:08,649
and then do dot config to enable the config. 
然后加上 ".config()" 以启动配置

8843
08:46:08,649 --> 08:46:11,769
Now this means we should be able to pull our rink the RPC URL from our dot env. 


8844
08:46:11,769 --> 08:46:15,849
Now that we have that in our Rinkeby network, 
现在我们已经有了 Rinkeby 网络

8845
08:46:15,879 --> 08:46:20,829
we can add URL Rinckey RPC URL. Awesome. 
我们就可以添加 "url: RINKEBY_RPC_URL"

8846
08:46:21,489 --> 08:46:24,999
So we have an RPC URL for different network. 
所以现在我们就有了一个不同网络的 "RPC URL"

8847
08:46:24,999 --> 08:46:27,969
But what else do we usually need? 
但我们还需要什么？

8848
08:46:27,969 --> 08:46:30,909
Well, we usually need a private key to work with an actual network, 
通常来说我们还需要为真实的网络提供一个私钥

8849
08:46:30,909 --> 08:46:33,939
or that doesn't automatically give us a private key for rugby, 
Hardhat 不会自动为我们提供用于 Rinkeby 的私钥

8850
08:46:33,939 --> 08:46:36,729
because Hardhead can't just give us test and the Etherium, 
因为 Hardhat 不能直接提供测试网的以太币

8851
08:46:36,849 --> 08:46:40,089
we need to have an actual account an actual test nets. 
我们需要在真实的测试网络上有一个实际的账户

8852
08:46:40,089 --> 08:46:43,749
Hardhead doesn't control those. So we have to actually give it a real URL and a real private key. 
Hardhat 不能提供这些，所以我们要为它提供一个真实的 URL 以及私钥

8853
08:46:43,749 --> 08:46:46,089
So to add private keys, you actually add something called accounts, 
要添加私钥，你需要添加一个 "account"

8854
08:46:46,119 --> 08:46:50,259
you add a list of accounts that you want to give to hard hat 
并添加一个你想提供给 Hardhat 的一个账户列表

8855
08:46:50,259 --> 08:46:53,169
for us, we're only going to add one, which is going to be our private key. 
对我们来说，只添加一个就好，这就是我们的私钥

8856
08:46:53,169 --> 08:46:55,629
And for our private key, we're going to do the exact same thing. 
对于私钥，我们要做的事情完全相同

8857
08:46:55,629 --> 08:46:59,199
We're gonna say const private key equals process dot e NV dot private key. 
就是 "const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY"

8858
08:46:59,859 --> 08:47:05,949
And since this private key is going to be a real private key for a real test net, 
因为这个私钥是一个存在于真实测试网络上的一个真正的私钥

8859
08:47:05,949 --> 08:47:09,159
again, we are going to have to grab this from our meta mask.
所以我们必须要从 MetaMask 中获取它

8860
08:47:09,159 --> 08:47:12,339
So it will go to our meta mask, three dots, account details, export private key, 
所以我们打开 MetaMask，点这三个点，账户详情，导出私钥

8861
08:47:12,369 --> 08:47:15,939
and we'll add our password in here.
在这里输入我们的密码

8862
08:47:15,969 --> 08:47:18,639
And then in our dot env will add private key 
接着在 ".env" 里添加 "PRIVATE_KEY = "

8863
08:47:20,710 --> 08:47:25,720
equals and then add our private key. 
最后添加我们的私钥

8864
08:47:25,720 --> 08:47:28,870
Now I know I've said this 100 times, but please, please, please, 
我知道我已经说了 100 遍了，但是请，请，请

8865
08:47:28,870 --> 08:47:33,700
for learning this, do not use a real key that is connected to any real money 
在学习这个的时候，不要使用任何与真钱有关联的私钥

8866
08:47:33,700 --> 08:47:37,270
just in case, please use a new meta mask. 
以防万一，请使用一个新的 MetaMask

8867
08:47:37,270 --> 08:47:40,180
I've know I've said it a bunch. But some people go no, I'm going to be okay, I'll be safe. 
我知道我说过很多遍了，但还是有些人会说，我没事，我很安全

8868
08:47:40,180 --> 08:47:43,630
Just to be super, super safe here, please use a brand new meta mask. 
但为了确保绝对安全，请使用一个全新的 MetaMask

8869
08:47:43,630 --> 08:47:47,020
So now that we have a private key, 
所以现在我们有了一个私钥

8870
08:47:47,020 --> 08:47:49,870
we're going to add it in here account private key. 
我们要把它放到这里 "account: [PRIVATE_KEY]"

8871
08:47:50,260 --> 08:47:53,650
And now we have an account here. 
现在我们在这里就有了一个账户了

8872
08:47:53,650 --> 08:47:58,390
One more thing I like to do is I like to give the chain ID of the network, 
还有一件我常做的事是，我喜欢提供网络的 "chainID"

8873
08:47:58,390 --> 08:48:02,890
which for Rigby is going to be for 
对 Rinkeby 来说就是 4

8874
08:48:02,920 --> 08:48:06,700
every single EVM base network as a new chain ID 
每一个 EVM 基础网络都有一个新的 chainID

8875
08:48:06,700 --> 08:48:10,390
and EVM network basically just means solidity works on it. This includes all test nets, 
EVM 网络的意思就是 Solidity 可以在其上面运行，这包括了所有的测试网络

8876
08:48:10,390 --> 08:48:13,510
there's a good site called chainless.org, which may or may not be going down at some point, 
有一个很好用的网站叫做 "chainlist.org"，有的时候可能会上不去

8877
08:48:13,510 --> 08:48:16,780
it has a list of all these different networks. 
它在列表中列出了所有这些不同的网络

8878
08:48:16,780 --> 08:48:19,630
For example, you can see on here a theory main net has a chain ID of one 
比如说，你可以看到以太网主网络的 chainID 是 1

8879
08:48:19,630 --> 08:48:24,760
byte and smart chain is 56, avalanches, 4311 for
"Binance Smart Chain" 是 56，"Avalanche" 是 43114

8880
08:48:24,790 --> 08:48:29,830
Phantom, opera 250, Polygon, 137, etc. 
"Fantom Opera" 是 250，"Polygon" 是 137 等等等等

8881
08:48:29,830 --> 08:48:33,850
Each one of these EVM compatible chains has their own chain ID, rank V, the chain ID is for 
每个 EVM 兼容链都有自己的 chainID，Rinkeby 的 chainID 是 4

8882
08:48:33,850 --> 08:48:38,020
adding the chain ID is helpful here for later on. And we'll get to that in the future. 
添加 chainID 有助于之后的一些操作，将来我们会涉及到这一点

8883
08:48:38,020 --> 08:48:40,390
But for now, just go ahead and make sure to add your chain IDs. 
但现在只需要确保添加你的 chainID 即可。

8884
08:48:40,390 --> 08:48:43,510
Okay, now that we have the RPC URL, we have the private key, 
好了，现在我们有了 "RPC URL" 和私钥

8885
08:48:43,510 --> 08:48:47,050
we can go ahead and test deploying this to an actual test net, 
就可以继续在实际的测试网上测试部署了

8886
08:48:47,050 --> 08:48:51,040
and actually did something incorrect


8887
08:48:51,040 --> 08:48:54,220
here. And we're gonna get an error here. And I want you to go


8888
08:48:54,220 --> 08:48:57,970
ahead and try to figure out and debug this error yourself.


8889
08:48:58,030 --> 08:49:03,610
You're ready. Alright, let's do it. We'll do yarn, hard hat, run


8890
08:49:03,610 --> 08:49:11,470
scripts, deploy dot j s, dash dash network Rinkeby. And we get


8891
08:49:11,470 --> 08:49:16,240
this wonderfully weird error, which we see we have deployed


8892
08:49:16,240 --> 08:49:20,200
contract. So we know that in our deploy script, we get to at


8893
08:49:20,200 --> 08:49:23,680
least this line, but then we're getting an error, I highly


8894
08:49:23,680 --> 08:49:26,890
likely hear what's going on saying cannot read properties


8895
08:49:26,890 --> 08:49:30,280
have no reading send transaction, if you want, you


8896
08:49:30,280 --> 08:49:33,340
can absolutely go to this spot. But it basically it looks like


8897
08:49:33,340 --> 08:49:36,340
it's having a hard time understanding what the private


8898
08:49:36,340 --> 08:49:40,540
key or what the account of this is. And what do you think I'm


8899
08:49:40,540 --> 08:49:43,630
going to recommend we do? Well, if it's not clear, after doing a


8900
08:49:43,630 --> 08:49:46,090
little bit of triaging and debugging, we're going to copy


8901
08:49:46,090 --> 08:49:49,600
this air. And we're going to come on over to Google and paste


8902
08:49:49,600 --> 08:49:54,250
that right in. It looks like we do get a question here from


8903
08:49:54,250 --> 08:49:57,520
stackexchange Etherium. And it looks like it's really similar


8904
08:49:57,790 --> 08:50:01,660
to what we're doing. We scroll down. They're running nearly the


8905
08:50:01,660 --> 08:50:04,180
exact same script that we're running, they're using MPX


8906
08:50:04,180 --> 08:50:08,440
instead of yarn. They've got a pretty minimalistic deploy file.


8907
08:50:08,740 --> 08:50:11,380
Let's scroll down and see what the answers have to say. I've


8908
08:50:11,380 --> 08:50:14,950
seen this error where my private key wasn't properly populated. I


8909
08:50:14,950 --> 08:50:17,500
would also use an environment variable I'm pretty sure Are


8910
08:50:17,500 --> 08:50:20,560
environment variables good. But we have a second one saying in


8911
08:50:20,560 --> 08:50:24,010
your heart head, I can think that Jas, it should be accounts


8912
08:50:24,040 --> 08:50:27,820
instead of account, it works for me, let's go back to our head


8913
08:50:27,820 --> 08:50:31,870
config and see if that's what's going on. Uh huh, we put account


8914
08:50:32,260 --> 08:50:34,570
in this should be accounts. So let's swap that over to


8915
08:50:34,570 --> 08:50:37,870
accounts. We'll clear our terminal. And we'll run this


8916
08:50:37,870 --> 08:50:41,620
again. Uh huh. And now it's reading a little bit longer,


8917
08:50:41,950 --> 08:50:44,590
which is good. This means that we're probably deploying this to


8918
08:50:44,590 --> 08:50:47,740
rink B, which is what we want to see. Awesome. And now we can see


8919
08:50:47,740 --> 08:50:51,250
deployed contract to, and we have a contract address here. So


8920
08:50:51,250 --> 08:50:54,400
we'll grab this contract. And we'll pop on over to bring the


8921
08:50:54,400 --> 08:50:57,580
ether scan, that's numbering the ether scan. And we'll go ahead


8922
08:50:57,580 --> 08:51:00,610
and we'll paste this in. Awesome. And we see our contract


8923
08:51:00,610 --> 08:51:04,690
was created about 26 seconds ago. Perfect. Now for this part,


8924
08:51:04,720 --> 08:51:07,600
you don't have to deploy this to rink be with me, if you follow


8925
08:51:07,600 --> 08:51:10,630
along here. That's good enough. So remember, the flying to test


8926
08:51:10,630 --> 08:51:13,960
that's can take a long time. So for this one, you don't have to


8927
08:51:13,960 --> 08:51:19,720
deploy with me.
