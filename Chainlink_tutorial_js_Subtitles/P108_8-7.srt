13138
13:18:55,840 --> 13:19:03,130
Oh, one


13139
13:19:03,130 --> 13:19:05,800
other point, something that you'll probably run into


13140
13:19:05,830 --> 13:19:09,820
multiple times. As we're doing this. If you get an error that


13141
13:19:09,820 --> 13:19:13,360
looks like this eath. JS query while formatting outputs from


13142
13:19:13,360 --> 13:19:17,200
RPC, nonce to high expected not to be too but got form, you will


13143
13:19:17,200 --> 13:19:20,560
definitely see this a whole lot. Here's what you do to fix this.


13144
13:19:20,680 --> 13:19:23,890
The reason this happens is because you've closed your


13145
13:19:23,890 --> 13:19:27,490
hardhat node and then restarted it, and your heart had node


13146
13:19:27,490 --> 13:19:30,610
goes, Okay, well, I'm starting fresh, I'm starting from zero.


13147
13:19:30,880 --> 13:19:34,240
But Metamask isn't smart enough to know that, what we want to do


13148
13:19:34,300 --> 13:19:36,850
is we want to come to our Metamask, we'll hit this big


13149
13:19:36,850 --> 13:19:40,540
button, we'll go down to settings, we'll go to Advanced,


13150
13:19:40,870 --> 13:19:44,050
and we'll go to reset account. And yes, we're going to reset


13151
13:19:44,050 --> 13:19:48,100
it. This isn't something ideally that you'd like to do with an


13152
13:19:48,100 --> 13:19:51,820
actual account with actual money on a local network, this is


13153
13:19:51,820 --> 13:19:54,940
fine. Now if you reset the account, and you reset the node,


13154
13:19:55,090 --> 13:19:58,030
we can go ahead and hit Confirm. And it doesn't give us that


13155
13:19:58,030 --> 13:20:01,180
error anymore. So that's kind of the tip there, you want to reset


13156
13:20:01,180 --> 13:20:04,120
the nuts so that our Metamask and our blockchain are in sync


13157
13:20:04,120 --> 13:20:05,410
with that nonce number.
