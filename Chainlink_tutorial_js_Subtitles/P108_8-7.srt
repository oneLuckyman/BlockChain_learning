13138
13:18:55,840 --> 13:19:03,130
Oh, one other point, 
哦，还有一点

13139
13:19:03,130 --> 13:19:05,800
something that you'll probably run into multiple times. As we're doing this. 
在这个过程中有一件事你可能会遇到很多次

13140
13:19:05,830 --> 13:19:09,820
If you get an error that looks like this 
如果你遇到了一个类似这样的报错

13141
13:19:09,820 --> 13:19:13,360
eath. JS query while formatting outputs from RPC, 
“[ethjs-query] 在格式化来自 RPC 的输出时”
("[ethjs-query] while formatting outputs from RPC")

13142
13:19:13,360 --> 13:19:17,200
nonce to high expected not to be too but got form, 
“nonce 的数值过高，预期为 2 但收到的是 4”
("nonce too high Expected nonce to be 2 but got 4")

13143
13:19:17,200 --> 13:19:20,560
you will definitely see this a whole lot. 
你肯定能看到它很多次

13144
13:19:20,680 --> 13:19:23,890
Here's what you do to fix this. 
接下来是解决它的办法

13145
13:19:23,890 --> 13:19:27,490
The reason this happens is because you've closed your hardhat node and then restarted it, 
发生这种情况的原因是，你曾关闭并重启了 Hardhat 的节点

13146
13:19:27,490 --> 13:19:30,610
and your heart had node goes, Okay, well, I'm starting fresh, I'm starting from zero.
你的 Hardhat 节点知道自己要刷新，要从零开始

13147
13:19:30,880 --> 13:19:34,240
But Metamask isn't smart enough to know that, 
但 MetaMask 却不够智能，不知道要这样做

13148
13:19:34,300 --> 13:19:36,850
what we want to do is we want to come to our Metamask, 
我们要做的是，前往我们的 MetaMask

13149
13:19:36,850 --> 13:19:40,540
we'll hit this big button, we'll go down to settings, we'll go to Advanced,
点击这个大按钮，进入“设置”("Settings")，进入“高级”("Advanced")

13150
13:19:40,870 --> 13:19:44,050
and we'll go to reset account. 
然后点击“重置账户”("Reset Account")

13151
13:19:44,050 --> 13:19:48,100
And yes, we're going to reset it. 
是的，我们要重置它

13152
13:19:48,100 --> 13:19:51,820
This isn't something ideally that you'd like to do with an actual account with actual money 
理想情况下我们并不喜欢对有实际资金的真实账户做这样的操作

13153
13:19:51,820 --> 13:19:54,940
on a local network, this is fine. 
但在本地网络上，这样做是可以的

13154
13:19:55,090 --> 13:19:58,030
Now if you reset the account, and you reset the node, we can go ahead and hit Confirm. 
现在，如果你重置了账户也重置了节点，就可以点击“确认”("Confirm")

13155
13:19:58,030 --> 13:20:01,180
And it doesn't give us that error anymore. 
然后它就不会给我们报那个错误了

13156
13:20:01,180 --> 13:20:04,120
So that's kind of the tip there, 
这就是这个小提示的全部内容

13157
13:20:04,120 --> 13:20:05,410
you want to reset the nuts so that our Metamask and our blockchain are in sync with that nonce number. 
你需要重置 nonce 以使 MetaMask 和区块链的 nonce 值达到同步
