11512
11:36:31,220 --> 11:36:36,740
Now


11513
11:36:36,740 --> 11:36:39,350
another incredibly powerful debugging tool that we're not


11514
11:36:39,350 --> 11:36:41,720
really going to go over here. But it's important to know about


11515
11:36:41,720 --> 11:36:43,850
because it can be really helpful is that you can actually use


11516
11:36:43,850 --> 11:36:48,050
console dot log in your solidity with hard hat. If you're inside


11517
11:36:48,050 --> 11:36:51,350
of a heart hat project, you just import hard hat slash console


11518
11:36:51,350 --> 11:36:56,090
dot soul. And then right in your solidity, you can do console dot


11519
11:36:56,090 --> 11:36:59,480
log, and then type pretty much whatever you want. When you


11520
11:36:59,480 --> 11:37:02,840
execute these functions, similar to how we do a console dot log


11521
11:37:02,840 --> 11:37:05,750
in JavaScript, those will actually console dot log out to


11522
11:37:05,750 --> 11:37:09,260
your terminal. Here's an example of if you run yarn, hard hat


11523
11:37:09,260 --> 11:37:12,650
test and you have those console dot logs, you'll see stuff like


11524
11:37:12,650 --> 11:37:16,370
this get printed out. So in addition to the Visual Studio


11525
11:37:16,370 --> 11:37:19,760
Code debugger, importing hard hat slash console dot Sol, and


11526
11:37:19,760 --> 11:37:23,000
using console dot logs in your solidity can also be an


11527
11:37:23,000 --> 11:37:25,610
effective debugging strategy. Feel free to give this video a


11528
11:37:25,610 --> 11:37:29,210
pause, implement this in some of our contracts and try it out in


11529
11:37:29,210 --> 11:37:35,210
our tests.
