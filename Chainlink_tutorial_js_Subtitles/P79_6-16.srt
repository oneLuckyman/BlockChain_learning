9873
09:52:14,200 --> 09:52:20,740
Alright, also now let's do this with TypeScript. 
好的，现在让我们使用 TypeScript 来进行操作

9874
09:52:20,740 --> 09:52:22,930
So I am going to go ahead and just start this from our JavaScript section. 
我将直接从我们的 JavaScript 部分开始来继续操作

9875
09:52:22,930 --> 09:52:25,570
However, if in the future, you want to start a new Hardhead project, 
但如果将来你打算开始一个新的 Hardhat 项目

9876
09:52:25,570 --> 09:52:28,000
you can actually start a new project with yarn, hard hat. 
那么你可以这样操作 "yarn hardhat" 

9877
09:52:29,050 --> 09:52:34,450
And then do great and advanced sample project that uses TypeScript, 
然后选择 "Create an advanced sample project that uses TypeScript" 
(“使用 TypeScript 创建一个高级示例项目”)

9878
09:52:34,450 --> 09:52:38,740
you'll add a ton of plugins. And you'll wait a while for everything to get uploaded. 
它会添加大量插件，你需要稍等一段时间直到所有内容上传完毕

9879
09:52:38,740 --> 09:52:41,380
And you wait, and you wait a little bit for everything to get downloaded. 
然后再稍微等一会儿直到所有内容下载完成

9880
09:52:41,380 --> 09:52:43,120
We're not going to do that though, 
我们并不会这样做

9881
09:52:43,120 --> 09:52:45,370
because I'm going to show you how to convert this to JavaScript Anyways, 
因为我将向你展示如何把这个转换为 JavaScript (口误，应为 TypeScript)

9882
09:52:45,370 --> 09:52:48,640
if in future hearted sections, as we're coding along with JavaScript, 
在未来的 Hardhat 部分，我们仍会采用 JavaScript 来编写代码

9883
09:52:48,640 --> 09:52:51,130
if you want to code along with TypeScript, you absolutely 100% can. 
但如果你想用 TypeScript 的话，也是百分百可以的

9884
09:52:51,130 --> 09:52:53,800
But let's go ahead and show you what the main differences are. 
现在让我来向你展示它们之间的主要差别是什么

9885
09:52:53,800 --> 09:52:57,100
Now that advanced TypeScript thing is going to add a whole bunch of packages that you may or may not want, 
现在，这个高级 TypeScript 选项添加了一大堆你可能用的到也可能用不到的包

9886
09:52:57,100 --> 09:52:59,620
I will talk about some of them in our next lesson. 
我会在下节课中讨论其中的某些

9887
09:52:59,620 --> 09:53:01,960
But there are going to be some that you absolutely do need. 
但有几个是你肯定会用到的

9888
09:53:01,960 --> 09:53:04,870
Those are going to be at type chain slash ethers, dash v five, at type chain, slash hard hat, 
它们是 "@typechain/ethers-v5 @typechain/hardhat"

9889
09:53:04,870 --> 09:53:07,510
at TypeScript, at types, slash Chai, at types, slash node, at types slash moko, 
"@types/chai @types/node @types/mocha"

9890
09:53:07,510 --> 09:53:14,650
TS node, type chain and TypeScript. 
"ts-node typechain" 以及 "typescript"

9891
09:53:14,680 --> 09:53:20,470
And I have a link in the GitHub repo associated with this course, 
我在课程关联的 GitHub 仓库中提供了一个链接

9892
09:53:20,470 --> 09:53:28,930
I've got this yarn ad that you can just copy paste, 
这里有一个 "yarn add" 后面的你可以直接复制粘贴

9893
09:53:28,930 --> 09:53:33,790
if you want to just copy paste that into your project to run it. 
如果你想的话可以直接把它们复制粘贴到你的项目中运行

9894
09:53:33,790 --> 09:53:36,640
Oops, and I should have added those as dev dependencies. 
哎呀，我还应该把它们添加到 "devDependencies" 里

9895
09:53:36,640 --> 09:53:39,160
So we're going to actually just make them dev dependencies real quick, 
我们可以很快地把它们放进 "devDependencies" 里

9896
09:53:39,160 --> 09:53:41,650
just by deleting these two lines, and adding a comma here. 
只要删除这两行，然后添加一个逗号就行了

9897
09:53:41,650 --> 09:53:44,260
Awesome, that looks much better. 
不错，看起来好多了

9898
09:53:44,260 --> 09:53:47,530
And then of course, what we're going to do is we're going to convert all of our JavaScript to TypeScript. 
当然，接下来要做的就是把 JavaScript 转换到 TypeScript 了

9899
09:53:47,530 --> 09:53:51,310
So anywhere where we have J S, we're going to put Ts, 
所以只要是 "js"，一律替换成 "ts"

9900
09:53:51,310 --> 09:53:54,400
obviously, if you're coding this from scratch with TypeScript, 
显然，如果你要从头开始使用 TypeScript

9901
09:53:54,400 --> 09:53:59,110
you would do the.ts From the get go. 
这里就要直接写成 ".ts" 

9902
09:53:59,200 --> 09:54:01,690



9903
09:54:01,690 --> 09:54:04,630
This includes our hard hat dot config, that's also going to be TypeScript now. 


9904
09:54:04,630 --> 09:54:08,110
And additionally, we're going to add a TS config dot JSON. 


9905
09:54:08,110 --> 09:54:10,420
This is going to be our TypeScript configuration. 


9906
09:54:10,420 --> 09:54:14,260
Typically, for a setup, we're gonna go with something like this. 


9907
09:54:14,260 --> 09:54:16,840
And you can copy this from the GitHub repo associated with this course. 


9908
09:54:16,840 --> 09:54:19,420
It's basically telling TypeScript, 


9909
09:54:19,420 --> 09:54:21,580
what versions of Typescript and what files to include for working with TypeScript. 


9910
09:54:21,610 --> 09:54:24,130
Now let's go ahead and start with our deploy dot TypeScript. 


9911
09:54:24,130 --> 09:54:27,100
For usual, instead of using require, 


9912
09:54:27,100 --> 09:54:30,370
we're gonna go ahead and use import, 


9913
09:54:30,370 --> 09:54:34,390
we're gonna do the exact same thing. 


9914
09:54:34,390 --> 09:54:37,990
We're gonna have import ethers run network, from hard hat. 


9915
09:54:37,990 --> 09:54:45,640
And then in our verify function, we're going to add that we're gonna add the types for these arguments. 


9916
09:54:45,790 --> 09:54:48,070
So contract address, is going to be a string. 


9917
09:54:48,070 --> 09:54:52,540
And args is going to be an array of arguments. 


9918
09:54:52,570 --> 09:54:56,260
So we're gonna say it's gonna be any array, 


9919
09:54:56,260 --> 09:54:59,410
because it could be string, it could be numbers, it could be balloons, it could be anything. 


9920
09:54:59,410 --> 09:55:02,200
We're also going to say for IE, going to say for IE, it could be any, 


9921
09:55:02,200 --> 09:55:04,840
even though this is technically an error type, 


9922
09:55:04,840 --> 09:55:08,230
we're just going to put any for simplicity. For now. 


9923
09:55:08,230 --> 09:55:12,160
All of our TypeScript scripts are included in our TS config, 


9924
09:55:12,520 --> 09:55:15,730
or any TypeScript files are manually added here, 


9925
09:55:15,730 --> 09:55:18,700
which we have Our entire scripts folder here, which is good. 


9926
09:55:18,730 --> 09:55:22,870
So now we need to add ethers in here. 


9927
09:55:22,870 --> 09:55:26,980
Well, if we look at our hardhead.config.ts, we're using require here still,


9928
09:55:27,040 --> 09:55:30,550
and we need to swap this out for import 


9929
09:55:30,550 --> 09:55:34,720
for Donnie V, you can use dot env slash config for it to grab your dot env file. 


9930
09:55:34,720 --> 09:55:38,050
Now that we've imported everything, go back to our deploy.ts, 


9931
09:55:38,050 --> 09:55:41,020
we can see that that linting has gone away. 


9932
09:55:41,020 --> 09:55:45,190
If you want to be even more explicit, we can go ahead and add import 


9933
09:55:45,850 --> 09:55:50,470
at nomic labs slash hard hat ethers like so. 


9934
09:55:50,470 --> 09:55:54,040
reason we don't need to import it here is because these two packages also work with Hardhead ethers, 


9935
09:55:54,040 --> 09:55:56,830
so they automatically import it. But if you want to be super explicit, 


9936
09:55:56,830 --> 09:56:00,220
you can go ahead and add it like so. 


9937
09:56:00,220 --> 09:56:03,730
Now, we're almost good to go. 


9938
09:56:03,730 --> 09:56:06,460
But remember, our Harnett dot config is also importing our tasks. 


9939
09:56:06,460 --> 09:56:10,990
So we're going to need to update our tasks or block number to be TypeScript fide. 


9940
09:56:11,020 --> 09:56:16,720
So of course, instead of const require, we're going to import task from our that slash config. 


9941
09:56:16,720 --> 09:56:19,630
And we're going to be sure to export our task from lock number as the default. 


9942
09:56:19,630 --> 09:56:23,350
So we're going to do export default task like so. 


9943
09:56:23,380 --> 09:56:28,960
And now we should be good to run our scripts. 


9944
09:56:28,960 --> 09:56:33,970
So we can just do yarn, art hat, run scripts, employee.ts. 


9945
09:56:34,330 --> 09:56:38,440
We can do network hard hat if we choose. And awesome. 


9946
09:56:38,470 --> 09:56:42,250
Now, it's when we get to the testing, that things get a little bit different here. 


9947
09:56:42,280 --> 09:56:45,400
So let's go ahead and change this required to import. 


9948
09:56:45,430 --> 09:56:50,410
Just to make it happy there. 


9949
09:56:50,440 --> 09:56:55,990
Let's try to run yarn, art head test, we get a whole bunch of errors, and in VS


9950
09:56:55,990 --> 09:56:58,930
code will actually go ahead and get these errors right from the


9951
09:56:58,930 --> 09:57:02,320
linter. One of the trickiest things that you run into as a


9952
09:57:02,320 --> 09:57:06,100
developer in this space is calling functions on contracts


9953
09:57:06,100 --> 09:57:09,520
where those functions don't exist, or vice versa. We're not


9954
09:57:09,520 --> 09:57:12,340
calling functions on contracts that do exist. Right now the


9955
09:57:12,340 --> 09:57:17,140
typing for our contracts is just type contract, which isn't super


9956
09:57:17,140 --> 09:57:20,290
helpful, because type contract doesn't necessarily have all the


9957
09:57:20,290 --> 09:57:23,440
functions that we want it to have. We want our contracts to


9958
09:57:23,440 --> 09:57:27,490
be of type contract, but we want them to be of the type of our


9959
09:57:27,490 --> 09:57:30,550
contract, because if they're the type of our contract, they can


9960
09:57:30,550 --> 09:57:33,880
have all the functions that we want them to have. So to give


9961
09:57:33,880 --> 09:57:37,330
our contracts the correct typing here, we actually can use this


9962
09:57:37,330 --> 09:57:40,870
tool called type chain, which gives our contracts correct


9963
09:57:40,900 --> 09:57:44,800
typing type chain has a hardened plugin, which allows us to use


9964
09:57:44,830 --> 09:57:47,890
type chain and TypeScript natively together, type chain


9965
09:57:47,890 --> 09:57:49,930
slash hard hat was one of these things that we already


9966
09:57:49,930 --> 09:57:53,440
installed. And to add it to our hard hat, we got to just go to


9967
09:57:53,440 --> 09:57:59,530
the hard hat config, and add it in import at type chain slash


9968
09:57:59,680 --> 09:58:03,910
arhat. Now once we import that in to our config, if we run yarn


9969
09:58:03,910 --> 09:58:08,860
hardhat, we now get a new task here called type chain, you read


9970
09:58:08,860 --> 09:58:11,650
the description, it says generate type chain typings for


9971
09:58:11,650 --> 09:58:15,460
compiled contracts, this will enable all of our contracts to


9972
09:58:15,460 --> 09:58:18,910
have their own typing. So we can have a simple storage variable


9973
09:58:18,970 --> 09:58:22,810
of type simple storage contract, which is much better, because


9974
09:58:22,810 --> 09:58:25,600
we're always going to know exactly what we can do with each


9975
09:58:25,600 --> 09:58:28,360
contract. To create this, we run yarn,


9976
09:58:28,810 --> 09:58:35,620
arhat type chain. And this is going to create a new folder


9977
09:58:35,680 --> 09:58:39,130
called type chain slash types. With types for all of our


9978
09:58:39,130 --> 09:58:42,400
contracts, you can even go into our simple storage sub Ts, which


9979
09:58:42,400 --> 09:58:44,650
is going to have all the different functions and


9980
09:58:44,890 --> 09:58:48,550
everything to do with our simple storage contract automatically


9981
09:58:48,550 --> 09:58:51,610
coded into Typescript and JavaScript for us, which is


9982
09:58:51,610 --> 09:58:54,400
incredibly helpful. And again, no, I haven't shown you what


9983
09:58:54,400 --> 09:58:57,520
this is yet. But in our dot Git ignore, we usually want to add


9984
09:58:57,520 --> 09:59:01,390
type chain and type chain dash types into our dot Git ignore so


9985
09:59:01,390 --> 09:59:04,630
we don't push them up to GitHub. Now back in our test, we're


9986
09:59:04,630 --> 09:59:09,220
going to add the exact types of these different objects here. So


9987
09:59:09,220 --> 09:59:12,130
we're going to import them from that folder that we just


9988
09:59:12,130 --> 09:59:17,950
created. So we'll do import simple storage, comma, simple


9989
09:59:17,950 --> 09:59:24,130
storage underscore underscore factory from dot dot slash


9990
09:59:24,190 --> 09:59:29,350
types, ain slash types, the simple storage factory is going


9991
09:59:29,350 --> 09:59:32,110
to be simple storage factory and then civil storage of course, is


9992
09:59:32,110 --> 09:59:36,730
going to be simple storage. So now when do let simple storage


9993
09:59:36,730 --> 09:59:42,430
factory which is going to be of type, simple storage, underscore


9994
09:59:42,430 --> 09:59:46,090
underscore factory, and then simple storage, which is going


9995
09:59:46,090 --> 09:59:51,820
to be of type simple storage contract. And if we command


9996
09:59:51,820 --> 09:59:55,390
clicked into simple storage, once again, we can see all the


9997
09:59:55,390 --> 09:59:59,380
contract functions that we know and love, are here. In addition,


9998
09:59:59,380 --> 10:00:03,970
we have all the functions of the actual contract itself. Once we


9999
10:00:03,970 --> 10:00:06,580
do that, we're pretty much good to go we just need to have a


10000
10:00:06,580 --> 10:00:10,540
couple of new things here. Get contract factory returns a type


10001
10:00:10,570 --> 10:00:13,420
ethers dot contract factory. So what we just need to do is we


10002
10:00:13,420 --> 10:00:17,410
need to wrap this in a simple storage factory type. So We'll


10003
10:00:17,410 --> 10:00:21,250
just do a little wrap like this. And we'll say, as simple


10004
10:00:21,670 --> 10:00:25,960
storage, I'm just going to sort of factory. And that's good to


10005
10:00:25,960 --> 10:00:28,930
go. Now that we've added all this, we can run yarn, Hardhead


10006
10:00:28,930 --> 10:00:33,970
test. And boom, our test run is normal, but with TypeScript and


10007
10:00:33,970 --> 10:00:37,060
with this additional typing that makes our lives substantially


10008
10:00:37,060 --> 10:00:39,880
substantially better. And that's going to be all you need to know


10009
10:00:39,880 --> 10:00:43,510
for TypeScript, reusable, all of the branches have an optional


10010
10:00:43,540 --> 10:00:46,870
TypeScript branch that you can use to reference to work with


10011
10:00:46,870 --> 10:00:47,410
TypeScript.
