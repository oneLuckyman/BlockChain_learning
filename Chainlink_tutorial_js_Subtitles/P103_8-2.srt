12521
12:40:00,730 --> 12:40:06,040
All right. So here we are, with a website or a front end 


12522
12:40:06,040 --> 12:40:10,000
on top of some smart contracts that we've deployed, 


12523
12:40:10,000 --> 12:40:12,430
doesn't really matter what it is


12524
12:40:12,430 --> 12:40:16,240
right now. This is typically the interface that you'll see boiled


12525
12:40:16,240 --> 12:40:20,350
down to a really, really minimalistic level. Typically,


12526
12:40:20,350 --> 12:40:22,270
you'll see something like connect function, right, and


12527
12:40:22,270 --> 12:40:25,180
Metamask, or some other wallet connector thing will pop up,


12528
12:40:25,390 --> 12:40:28,420
we'll hit Next we'll connect here might even say something


12529
12:40:28,420 --> 12:40:30,970
like connected. And we can also execute functions, we can


12530
12:40:31,000 --> 12:40:33,580
interact with our smart contracts, we can confirm, etc.


12531
12:40:33,610 --> 12:40:35,950
Right? This is something you might see something like Avi


12532
12:40:35,950 --> 12:40:39,010
right, I'll hit Connect on the application, it'll say, hey, how


12533
12:40:39,010 --> 12:40:41,890
would you like to connect? I'll choose Metamask. I'm going to


12534
12:40:41,950 --> 12:40:45,040
change my Metamask to main net, but you get the picture, right?


12535
12:40:45,040 --> 12:40:48,760
This is a simple example of what that would look like. So what is


12536
12:40:48,820 --> 12:40:52,630
actually going on in the browser when we connect what is actually


12537
12:40:52,630 --> 12:40:55,450
going on? And what do we actually need to do, we're going


12538
12:40:55,450 --> 12:40:59,500
to right click, hit Inspect. And on the right side, we're gonna


12539
12:40:59,500 --> 12:41:04,810
see our debugger here. Now if we go over to sources, on the top


12540
12:41:04,810 --> 12:41:09,790
of our browser, you'll see a few things. If you look down over


12541
12:41:09,790 --> 12:41:14,050
here, right, we'll see this URL, right, which right now is going


12542
12:41:14,050 --> 12:41:18,010
to be my localhost. And we'll also see meta mask and Phantom


12543
12:41:18,010 --> 12:41:20,710
and a whole bunch of other stuff. These other things that


12544
12:41:20,710 --> 12:41:24,130
we see here are going to be what's injected from our browser


12545
12:41:24,130 --> 12:41:27,130
extensions. The reason we see this meta mask thing here is


12546
12:41:27,130 --> 12:41:30,250
because I've meta mask installed, right? The reason I


12547
12:41:30,250 --> 12:41:33,160
see Phantom here is because I have the Phantom app installed.


12548
12:41:33,910 --> 12:41:37,630
Meta masks, of course, being an EVM, wallet and Phantom being a


12549
12:41:37,630 --> 12:41:40,990
Solana based wallet. Now what happens when we have these


12550
12:41:41,260 --> 12:41:45,010
extensions installed is they automatically get injected into


12551
12:41:45,040 --> 12:41:49,240
a window object in JavaScript, and in fact, we scroll down


12552
12:41:51,520 --> 12:41:54,880
to here in the console, again, you can find console, you can


12553
12:41:54,880 --> 12:41:59,020
click here and click anything up there. And we type in window.


12554
12:41:59,950 --> 12:42:02,890
We'll see we have this big window object with all this


12555
12:42:02,890 --> 12:42:06,880
stuff, right? This window object represents this our window


12556
12:42:06,970 --> 12:42:09,760
basically right? Now if we scroll all the way to the bottom


12557
12:42:11,350 --> 12:42:16,180
and we do window dot Aetherium. We also see an object here. Now


12558
12:42:16,180 --> 12:42:20,800
this window dot Aetherium object only exists if you have a meta


12559
12:42:20,800 --> 12:42:25,210
mask or meta mask like browser or if you want to look at some


12560
12:42:25,210 --> 12:42:29,320
other web three wallet you do window dot Solana. So Alana


12561
12:42:30,010 --> 12:42:33,340
right and we see this window dot Solana. Now let's look at a


12562
12:42:33,340 --> 12:42:36,610
browser that doesn't have Metamask or phantom installed.


12563
12:42:36,640 --> 12:42:38,830
What do you think is going to happen in the window now let's


12564
12:42:38,830 --> 12:42:41,140
go ahead and right click hit Inspect. We'll go to the


12565
12:42:41,140 --> 12:42:45,130
console. Now let's see what's going on in here. If we go to


12566
12:42:45,130 --> 12:42:48,880
sources, we first off we don't see that Metamask or that Solana


12567
12:42:48,880 --> 12:42:52,990
source here. And if we go to console, we still see window if


12568
12:42:52,990 --> 12:42:55,870
I let me zoom in a little bit. We still see window here. But if


12569
12:42:55,870 --> 12:42:59,920
I do window dot Aetherium If we get nothing, or if I do window


12570
12:42:59,920 --> 12:43:04,450
dot Solana, we also get nothing. So in order for our browsers to


12571
12:43:04,450 --> 12:43:08,110
know that there's a Metamask, or that there's a phantom, those


12572
12:43:08,110 --> 12:43:11,500
extensions automatically add these to our window objects, and


12573
12:43:11,500 --> 12:43:14,740
that's something that we can check for in our JavaScript. The


12574
12:43:14,740 --> 12:43:17,500
reason these wallets are so important is built into them


12575
12:43:17,530 --> 12:43:21,310
underneath the hood, they have a blockchain node connected to


12576
12:43:21,310 --> 12:43:24,340
them. And in order to interact with the blockchain, we always


12577
12:43:24,340 --> 12:43:28,570
need a note. And you might have seen URLs from alchemy, or in


12578
12:43:28,570 --> 12:43:31,600
FIRA because you need them to interact with the blockchain,


12579
12:43:32,050 --> 12:43:35,410
Alchemy, and infura are examples of third party blockchains that


12580
12:43:35,650 --> 12:43:38,530
you can interact with and basically rent, right. But you


12581
12:43:38,530 --> 12:43:42,340
need them to create a provider, or a node to send your


12582
12:43:42,340 --> 12:43:45,790
transactions to. So you could do it in JavaScript, like something


12583
12:43:45,790 --> 12:43:48,370
like this is the alchemy documentation where you take


12584
12:43:48,370 --> 12:43:52,600
that alchemy URL, you stick it into some object and use that to


12585
12:43:52,600 --> 12:43:56,410
send your transaction. This is a way that you could do it in the


12586
12:43:56,410 --> 12:43:59,440
back end. But on the front end, what you normally want to use is


12587
12:43:59,440 --> 12:44:03,040
you just want to use the user's Metamask, or their Solana or


12588
12:44:03,040 --> 12:44:06,970
their wallet as the main wallet. Now, there are a ton of other


12589
12:44:06,970 --> 12:44:09,610
different types of wallets to connect, like ledger, mu,


12590
12:44:09,610 --> 12:44:13,210
Coinbase, wallet, connect, etc. And there are different ways to


12591
12:44:13,210 --> 12:44:17,380
set those up. But they all do the same thing where they expose


12592
12:44:17,410 --> 12:44:21,460
some URL, they expose some node under the hood, they give us


12593
12:44:21,460 --> 12:44:25,960
that URL. They give us that provider. The way metamath Does


12594
12:44:25,960 --> 12:44:30,580
it is with window dot Aetherium. Boom, this is now our URL. This


12595
12:44:30,580 --> 12:44:34,480
is now our connection. In fact, if you go up to your Metamask,


12596
12:44:35,380 --> 12:44:41,740
hit the little three dots, expand view. hit Add Network,


12597
12:44:42,160 --> 12:44:45,820
and then just hit the X so we can get to networks. You can see


12598
12:44:45,850 --> 12:44:49,960
all of these blockchains that I have in here all have an RPC


12599
12:44:49,960 --> 12:44:54,580
URL, this the HTTP RPC URL connection of the blockchain No,


12600
12:44:54,580 --> 12:44:56,980
that's running. I happen to have one running locally right now.


12601
12:44:59,260 --> 12:45:03,070
All of these also have a node RPC URL and you can actually see


12602
12:45:03,070 --> 12:45:06,280
them right in your meta mask right. This is connected to in


12603
12:45:06,280 --> 12:45:10,240
Fira, these are all connected to in Fira. It's all the exact same


12604
12:45:10,240 --> 12:45:13,270
thing. Meta mask just has a really nice way of taking that


12605
12:45:13,270 --> 12:45:16,960
URL, sticking it in the browser for us in this window dot


12606
12:45:16,960 --> 12:45:21,310
Aetherium or window dot Solana you know or whatever. So this is


12607
12:45:21,310 --> 12:45:23,920
the main thing that we need to know we need. We always need a


12608
12:45:23,920 --> 12:45:27,460
connection with the blockchain. And these browser wallets are an


12609
12:45:27,490 --> 12:45:31,360
easy way to do that. Make sense? Great. Let's take this knowledge


12610
12:45:31,360 --> 12:45:32,230
now. And let's


12611
12:45:32,260 --> 12:45:38,920
apply it.
